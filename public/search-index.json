It is the way we structure and label content in an effective and user-friendly manner.\nInformation architecture helps improve the usability and accessibility of digital products and services.\nIt is how the content of applications, websites, and information systems are organized and labeled for easy access and usage, saving users considerable time.\nA good information architecture anticipates user needs and ensures a logical flow of information is followed through intelligent grouping and intuitive navigation medium.\nFigure 1: Key element of information architecture\nGood information architecture equates to a good user experience. For that reason, information architecture focuses on where users can find information easily and connect three important elements for effective delivery, namely:\nUser: The first step to useful technical documentation is understanding the users’ needs, goals, and mental models when seeking new information. This is to ensure information structure aligns with users’ ways of thinking and searching.\nContent: This is the actual information behind the Information architecture. It consists of content structure, its organization, labeling, images and media used.\nContext: This focuses on the environment and circumstances where users access information so the technical article is readily usable in different situations.\nImportance of information architecture in technical documentation Information architecture plays a crucial role in technical documentation in multiple ways. It helps technical writers create clear and concise documents, promoting usability and strengthening comprehension of complex technical content for users.\nBelow are the key importance of information architecture in technical documentation.\nSound user experience: Information architecture ensures technical documentation is organized logically and intuitively, allowing users to access the required information quickly and efficiently. It adds structure and intuitive navigation to simplify complex information for users. This leads to greater user satisfaction and reduces frustration.\nConsistency: Technical documentation with good information architecture appears more consistent in terms of vocabulary, text formatting, and content style, which improves the document’s professionalism and reduces confusion among readers, particularly when dealing with complex technical concepts.\nEase of search: Technical documentation frequently uses jargon and complicated vocabulary. By implementing a well-structured, Information hierarchy and incorporating effective metadata and glossary, a well-executed search engine helps readers locate relevant information.\nAccessibility: Strong information architecture makes technical documentation accessible to everyone, including users with assistive technology. As a writer, anticipate readers with diverse needs. IA empowers you to build content by factoring in these user classes, and creating clear, labeled, and well-structured documentation for everyone.\nPromotes collaboration: Information architecture streamlines collaboration between technical writers and stakeholders, guaranteeing a unified approach to crafting user-centric documentation. This shared framework fosters cooperation and aligns contributions with the core objective.\nEncourages content reusability: Information architecture promotes the development of reusable and modular information pieces. This method simplifies the documentation process, reduces duplication, and guarantees uniformity among various forms of documentation.\nStrengthens understanding: Information architecture ensures information is arranged logically and sequentially, facilitating readers’ comprehension of the connections and context between various documentation sections. This facilitates understanding and makes it easier for readers to absorb technical ideas easily.\nInformation architecture taxonomy In Information architecture, taxonomy is crucial in organizing and labeling content using a hierarchical structure.\nIt is how information is segmented and labeled within a shared information environment. It helps organize topics, subtopics, and related content within manuals and guides.\nFigure 2: Taxonomy in use in The Atlantic website\nThe picture above is a taxonomy being used in The Atlantic to specify broad categories like “Technology”, “Business”, “Global”, “Health”. It makes information easily discoverable and also strengthens SEO\nThink of Information architecture as a clothing store; the taxonomy is the dedicated space where each shopper will find men\u0026rsquo;s, ladies\u0026rsquo;, children’s, and babies\u0026rsquo; shoes and accessories.\nThen the clothing store will have other subcategories where dresses, pants, jackets, and shirts are found within the ladies\u0026rsquo; clothing section.\nFigure 3: Information architecture and taxonomy working together to deliver content efficiently in an e-commerce platform\nThe picture above is a prime example of Jumia, an e-commerce platform that makes efficient use of taxonomy.\nThe items listed on the far left are termed as information architecture, On clicking any of the listed items and in this case “Fashion”, we could see the subcategories like “WOMEN’S FASHION”, “MEN’S FASHION”, “KID’S FASHION”, “WATCHES”, “SUNGLASSES”, and “TOP BRAND”.\nAnother example is the navigation menu on your favorite website. Each menu option serves as the taxonomy, and it could consist of a sub-menu where users can find similar information that relates to each other.\nNow that you understand what information architecture taxonomy is all about, let\u0026rsquo;s find out how to curate ours about information architecture.\nThe key steps for drafting an information architecture taxonomy are explained below.\nIdentify the audience: Understanding your audience is crucial for creating an effective taxonomy with their needs and expectations. Here are key aspects to consider when you want to identify your audience.\nRoles and responsibilities: You need to determine who would be using your technical documentation, the likely skill they intend on learning, their job role, and what task they will perform using the documentation. Answering these questions helps you understand their objectives and workflows, which aids you with structuring information accordingly.\nTechnical expertise: Your users\u0026rsquo; technical knowledge and experience will influence the terminology, complexity, and depth of information you include.\nInformation needed: You need to know the specific information your users need. Then, you categorize these needs into topics, subtopics, related topics, and references to other articles that could fill a gap, especially for those needing a certain skill before they can grasp the content of the technical documentation you are offering them.\nEnsure you prioritize the most essential information based on your users\u0026rsquo; needs.\nContext of use: Consider how users access the documentation, e.g., online, printed, or mobile. Also, consider In what environment it would be used.\nExpectations and user preference: Find out how users typically search for information which could range from keywords, exploration e.t.c. Find out what level of detail is expected and formatting preferences if possible.\nMethod of gathering information: You should review existing documentation feedback to know what users like and want as an improvement. You can also conduct surveys and web analytics and collaborate with subject matter experts to gather insights and validate assumptions.\nMap out user journey: Do a walk-through on the steps users will take when interacting with the documentation.\nNote down likely pain points users are trying to find answers to and the key decision point where they will find a solution to their probing question in your documentation.\nCreate content categories: To do this, you have to define the content goal. Do you want them to learn to perform a task successfully, find specific information, or troubleshoot? Figure 4: Table of content showing content category for easy navigation\nThe above image is an example of a technical documentation on hashnode. The content goal has been defined, which is an article on “Navigating AWS IPV4”.\nIf we then pay a closer look at the content category for this article, we can see how intentional the writer is with regards to enlightening his readers and what he wants them to learn when they read his article.\nOnce you have an answer to the question above, you can do the following.\nAnalyze existing content: Pay close attention to all content items, topics, format, and organization. Identify gaps and overlaps to know if any topic is missing or needs better coverage based on user feedback. Also, identify any redundant content.\nCard sorting: Understand how content items are grouped to understand categorization preferences.\nIdentify key concepts and relationships: Break down subject matter into topics and subtopics, forming a hierarchical Tree structure. Consider how each topic relates to the other such as the parent-child relationship, part of the topic, or sequential process.\nChoose category labels: Ensure chosen terms are clear and concise. Avoid technical jargon that might be unfamiliar at all costs.\nAlso, ensure you use consistent terminology throughout the taxonomy to avoid confusion on the user\u0026rsquo;s part.\nCreate content hierarchy: To do this, you should think like a user and structure content as a user would think when searching for information. Place essential topics at the top of the hierarchy and group related content together for easy access. Also, consider future changes and growth when curating your content hierarchy.\nDefine layout and navigation: Consider information density and visual hierarchy in your documentation. Use headings, spacings, and visual elements to guide users and signal importance. You should balance text with visuals (gifs, sketches, videos, images) to break up content and aid understanding. A user-friendly navigation system should also be considered.\nYou should consider the following navigation methods.\nGlobal navigation: Consistent top-level access to primary categories should be present throughout the documentation. Example: Kubernetes documentation makes good use of this by using a clear and consistent global navigation bar at the top of every page and it remains visible wherever you are on the page.\nIt also provides easy access to key sections of the documentation like “Getting started”, “Concept”, “Task”. And lastly, the user’s location within the documentation at any particular time is highlighted for easy tracking.\nFigure 5: Global navigation system of kubernetes documentation website\nLocal navigation: Provide navigation for lengthy contents such as breadcrumbs, \u0026ldquo;jump to\u0026rdquo; links, and table of contents.\nSearch functionality: Implement a robust search feature for quick content delivery.\nFigure 6: Local navigation and search functionality on kubernetes documentation website\nWhile still on the Kubernetes documentation example used in Global navigation, from the image above, we can see those highlighted texts in blue. They serve as a :jump to” links mentioned in the examples above.\nThey are useful when a user needs to read more about that particular piece of information. It also provides a well-integrated search feature on the page to enable users to discover relevant documentation based on keywords.\nFollowing these steps diligently will let you create a taxonomy that organizes information logically and resonates with your target audience.\nBenefit of taxonomy for your technical documentatiion Improved user experience: A well-defined taxonomy leads to a positive user experience by making it easier for users to find what they need and complete their tasks.\nDocumentation consistency: Using a consistent taxonomy ensures that similar information is always grouped, making it easier for users to understand the overall structure of the information.\nEfficient content management: A well-defined taxonomy makes organizing and managing large amounts of content easier.\nSearch result: By aligning the taxonomy with search keywords, you can ensure that users get more relevant results when they search for specific information.\nCheck your knowledge:\nQuestion 1: Why is taxonomy important when building your information architecture for technical documentation?\nIt enhances user understanding by grouping related topics together It eliminates the need for usability testing It forces users to follow a specific path in the documentation It ensures all topic are covered Question 2: What is the primary goal of information architecture in technical documentation?\nTo reduce maintenance cost To make technical documentation visually appealing To replace the need for clear writing To improve findability for users How to create an information architecture for your technical documentation User research: Understanding the problem space is the first step in creating a good information architecture. It isn\u0026rsquo;t uncommon to see an article on a particular topic, but that article doesn\u0026rsquo;t explain succinctly what the users need. Research would let you know what knowledge gap you are trying to fill, how to approach the topic based on the reviews you\u0026rsquo;ve seen on existing content, how readers think when exploring digital repositories, and what type of reader is your target audience.\nUser research lets you define your audience and goals.\nContent inventory: This is where you collate all existing articles on a particular topic and then audit each one in order to gather insights on how useful and accurate the information is to readers, what is missing, and what needs to be added to make for a sound article that would help users find what they are looking for easily.\nInformation grouping and classification: After you must have settled for an area in which you want to focus your article on, the next logical step is to note down what each section of the article contains and what are their sub-sections. This would create a logical hierarchy and a seamless way for users to understand your thought process, the information you wish to impact on them, and how each sub-section relates to the main section.\nProper labeling and taxonomy: Create a clear and concise label that leaves no room for ambiguity. Users should understand what your label means at the first read without having to guess second what that section is all about.\nDefine hierarchy and navigation structure: Rank information based on its importance to the readers. A user who intends to read an article on a particular topic has a particular pain point they are trying to solve.\nYour duty is to instinctively know what that information is and place it where it would serve them best. You should also consider the best navigation structure for your content that would serve users well without any frustration, whether it is a table of content or another navigation style.\nGather feedback and iterate: Be sure to test your article /documentation with real users as well as your fellow technical writers to gather insight on what you have done right and what needs to be adjusted, and iterate based on feedback obtained.\nInformation architecture principles to consider when drafting your technical documentation Crafting effective information architecture is not a game of chance. It\u0026rsquo;s a disciplined process guided by established principles and methodologies.\nIt starts with a deep understanding of the application, content, and organizational goals, followed by the consistent application of established principles throughout the process.\nThe principle of objects: Content should be viewed as a living and breathing document with unique characteristics, lifecycle, behaviors, and attributes. Content is more than just static text as each piece of information evolves from creation to publication, revision, and eventual removal when it has served its use.\nThe principle of choices: Overloading users with too much information leads to a bad user experience. Humans have a short attention span; therefore, create pages that offer meaningful choices to users without them having to stress their brain.\nThe principle of disclosure: Present users with just enough information they can understand at a stretch and let them decide if they want to explore further. So technical articles often have an external link for readers who want to dive deeper. In summary, embrace a progressive disclosure approach by gradually unveiling more information as users dictate interest.\nThe principle of exemplars: Some sections are not self-explanatory for an average user when writing technical documents. Provide examples as an image to exemplify the content as images are more visually appealing than text, and your readers will grasp the initial text easily afterwards.\nThe principle of first doors: Not all users will get to read your article right from the start as some of your audience could come in contact with it through optimized keyword search. Therefore, provide a welcoming experience at every point with relevant information and clear navigation that would make the site accessible to them.\nThe principle of multiple classification: Accommodate diverse User preferences by providing multiple ways for users to search the content on your site. factoring keyword searches, top-level menus, and intuitive browsing mechanisms are some ways of doing this, but some users might wish to browse or move through the hierarchy, so make sure your information architecture meets their needs.\nThe principle of focused navigation It emphasizes the importance of clarity and consistency in navigation design. This would help readers understand the content structure and easily locate the needed information.\nThe principle of growth: Embrace flexibility and anticipate future expansion as there is every likelihood that the content you start with will evolve over time. Ensure it remains organized and scalable.\nExercise\nChoose a complex technical concept of your choice, research extensively and write on it. Ensure you apply all you\u0026rsquo;ve learnt about information architecture and adhere to all the tips and measures from this documentation.\nAfter review, tag @TechnicalWriti6 on Twitter to the link to your article.\nAnswer the following questions Loading...

An audience refers to the people who will engage with your content. They could be customers, users, or anyone interested in what you have to say.\nIdentifying your audience helps you create content that resonates with them, whether it’s a product manual, a blog post,\nIt is critical to paint a clear picture of who you are writing for since your readers are different; they may differ in education, interest, technicality, and many others. This is where audience analysis comes in.\nWhat is Audience Analysis? Audience analysis is a process of understanding, researching, and interpreting information about your intended audience.\nThis examination helps you tailor your writing to your audience\u0026rsquo;s needs, expectations, and characteristics.\nIt is a vital starting point for creating any technical document, whether an instructional manual for a device intended for a general audience or a tutorial for software developers.\nIn a nutshell, Audience analysis is a way for writers to get to know their audience.\nImportance of Audience Analysis Audience analysis is vital in technical writing; it makes it easier for you to write to reach your document\u0026rsquo;s goal.\nSome reasons why audience analysis is essential.\n1. Knowledge Transfer: The goal of technical writing is to help professionals convey knowledge to end-users. Technical writers can ensure that knowledge is efficiently delivered by streamlining the transfer by recognizing the audience\u0026rsquo;s level of expertise with the subject area.\n2. Effective Communication: Knowing your audience helps you to convey your message in a manner that is clear, concise, and relevant to them since communication is a two-way process.\n3. Empathy and Connection: Audience analysis enhances empathy; this entails putting them in your shoes, it goes beyond passing information, it creates a shared experience.\n4. Increased Engagement: An audience\u0026rsquo;s attention is captured, and engagement is sustained when your content speaks directly to their problems or is in line with their specific needs or interests.\n5. Preventing Miscommunication: Inability to understand your audience can lead to miscommunication and confusion; you can avoid using inappropriate language and assumptions by analyzing your audience.\n6. Building Credibility: Showing that you understand your audience builds credibility. Your audience is more likely to trust your information if they perceive you as knowledgeable about their needs and concerns.\nSteps in Audience Analysis There are several steps to conduct audience analysis; they include:\n1. Define the Purpose of Communication: Clarifying the purpose of your communication is an important step in audience analysis; it serves as a guiding principle regarding the content, tone, and delivery.\nYou need to know what you aim to achieve with your communication. Is your writing meant to inform, instruct, or persuade?\nFor example, are you writing a technical manual to guide users or writing content to promote a product?\nDefining your purpose lays the foundation for delivering an effective message that resonates with your audience.\n2. Gather Information about your Audience: Information gathering helps you find as much information as possible about the audience you are writing for.\nThe more information you gather, the easier it will be for your writing.\nSome of the questions you will ask to get the needed information are:\nWho is the audience?\nWhat do they need to know?\nWhen will they be reading?\nWhy will they be reading?\nHow will they be reading?\nYou can use tools like Typeform and Survey Monkey to gather information about your audience.\n3. Define Your Type of Audience: After gathering information about your audience, define your audience type based on the information.\nYour audience could be a professional, an expert, or a novice. Defining your audience will help you determine the existing knowledge of your readers.\nTypes of Audiences Audiences can broadly be categorized into two main groups;\nTechnical Audiences Non-Technical Audiences 1. Technical Audience: These individuals have a specialized understanding of a technical subject. They possess expertise gained through training, education, or professional experience in a particular field.\nThey include software developers, IT professionals, data analysts, and other specialized professionals. Communicating with technical audiences involves using precise technical languages and providing detailed documentation.\nTechnical audiences can be grouped into:\nLow-level Technical Audiences High-level Technical Audiences 2. Low-level Technical Audiences: This refers to individuals who have a foundational understanding of technical concepts within a specific domain.\nThey may be novice programmers, developers, entry-level technicians, or those with limited knowledge in a technical field.\nExamples of writing may include an introduction to html and CSS for beginners in web development.\nWriting for these audiences is foundational, which requires simpler and more detailed explanations to enable them to build their skills.\nBelow is an article written for low-level technical audiences.\nFigure 1.A Documentation written for low-level Technical Audiences\n3. High-level Technical Audiences: This refers to individuals with an advanced understanding of complex technical terms.

Write in Active Voice: Using active voice makes it easier for your readers to understand the intended meaning of a sentence. It is a valuable tip for achieving plain language in your writing.\nExample\nActive voice: \u0026ldquo;The team lead gave feedback\u0026rdquo;.\nPassive voice: \u0026ldquo;The feedback was given by the team lead\u0026rdquo;\nActive voice: \u0026ldquo;The Scrum master implemented changes to the Kanban board\u0026rdquo;\nPassive voice: \u0026quot; The changes to the Kanbaan board were implemented by the Scrum master.\n2. Use Short Sentences as much as Possible: Clear writing should have an average of 15 to 20 words, though every sentence must not be the same length. Stick one main idea in a sentence.\n3. Use Consistent Words: Avoid using different words with the same meaning to your readers. Use coherent words.\nExample:\nIf you use the word \u0026ldquo;For example\u0026rdquo; to refer to an illustration, don\u0026rsquo;t change it to \u0026ldquo;for instance\u0026rdquo; in another line of your documentation.\n4. Use Everyday Words: Use commonly used words that will not confuse your readers or give them a hard time grabbing the content of your documentation. If you must use technical terms, explain them first in your sentence.\nFor example, use \u0026ldquo;end\u0026rdquo; instead of \u0026ldquo;terminate\u0026rdquo;, and “use”\n5. Write Directly to your Readers: Use the second person point of view to refer to your readers, such as \u0026ldquo;you\u0026rdquo;, and \u0026ldquo;your\u0026rdquo;, remember you are writing for your readers, not yourself.\nExample;\nIn this documentation, you will learn how to create a hamburger using HTML and CSS.\nAvoiding Technical Jargon What is Technical Jargon?

Fields like engineering, medicine, and science all have their jargon.\nFor example, words like application programming interface(API), A/B Testing, and Augmented Reality(AR) are all jargon in information technology.\nJargon can be used if your audience is professionals in a field to establish authority, But if your audience is the general public or a layman, then you have to translate all your jargon into a common expression\nHow to Avoid Jargon Technical jargon can pose challenges to those who are not familiar with the specialized terminology, below are how to avoid it.\n1. Know your Audience: Understand the knowledge and expertise of your audience. it is okay to use jargon if your audience understands it, but if you speak to people outside your field or newbies, use generally understood terms or define words.\n2. Get a second person to read your work: It is best to have someone else proofread it and give you feedback. They can see which words are clear or confusing.\nTry to pick someone who is your target audience, ask them if there are words they don\u0026rsquo;t understand, and ask if the words compel them to take action on its purposes or if they are bored.\n3. Read your Writing out Loud: Read your writing out loud to notice words and phrases that may sound complex; this is because spoken words reveal complexities that may go unnoticed when reading silently.\nIt probably reads that way if it sounds awkward or unnatural. Rewrite it until it sounds like plain speech.\nEliminating confusing jargon and paying attention to your audience\u0026rsquo;s words will help you communicate more effectively and win their trust.\nWriting for Different Levels of Expertise When you write content for different levels of expertise, you need to adjust it to suit individuals with varying levels of knowledge and experience on the topic.\nThis approach acknowledges that your audience may consist of beginners, intermediate users, advanced practitioners, and experts.\nThe ultimate purpose is to ensure that everyone within your target audience can access and benefit from your content. Here\u0026rsquo;s a breakdown of what writing for different levels of expertise entails.\n1. Novice/Beginners: These individuals are new to a particular subject or technology. They have limited or no prior experience in the area being discussed. They may seek to understand the basics, grasp fundamental concepts, and learn to navigate or use a specific technology. They require Clear explanations and step-by-step instructions.\nFor Example, a \u0026ldquo;Docker for beginners\u0026rsquo;\u0026rsquo; documentation should contain a strong introduction, installation, basic commands, and how to use them.\n2. The Advanced Beginners: These individuals have moved past the novice stage and acquired some basic knowledge in a particular technology or field. Advanced beginners understand the subject matter and have gained the confidence to explore more advanced tasks.\nFor example, documentation on \u0026ldquo;Advanced React\u0026rdquo; should include real-world examples to enable them to gain hands-on experience.\n3. The Competent: These individuals possess a solid understanding of the technology or field. They are capable of handling more complex tasks independently. They have gained experience and are used to advanced terminology.\nWriting for the competent should be specific since they use the technical documentation for reference rather than relying on it for learning. The content should reflect their proficiency level.\n4. Proficient: These individuals have mastered a particular technology or field. They comprehensively understand the subject matter and possess advanced skills to navigate complex concepts easily. Writing for proficient users entails advanced insights, detailed technical analysis, and in-depth discussions of advanced cases.\n5. The Experts: These include users at the peak of knowledge and expertise in a particular field or technology. They have a deep understanding and extensive experience of complex concepts.\nTechnical documentation for experts should be advanced and sophisticated. It should reflect their advanced knowledge and expectations. It should provide insights beyond the basics and cater to professionals seeking the latest and most advanced information.\nAnswer the following questions.\nLoading...

How to create a writing style guide Why is it important for technical writers to have a writing style guide? Popular style guides and how to pick one for your project What is a writing style guide? A writing style guide, also known as a manual of style, is a document containing standards (rules) for writing and formatting documents. Its purpose is to assist writers in maintaining consistency in their writing style and ensuring that the documentation is clear and easy to understand.\nWhether crafting a blog article or collaborating with a documentation team, a style guide is crucial in maintaining a consistent brand voice and tone. Without this consistency in your writing style, your readers may struggle to grasp your intended message.\nFor instance, observe how the Google Developers documentation style guide utilizes its guide to maintain consistency.\nIn the following example, you\u0026rsquo;ll see clear guidelines on formatting lists. They not only provide clear guidelines but also examples on representing various list types in their documentation and how to introduce them.\nGoogle Developers Documentation Style Guide Sample\nIntroductory sentences for lists\nIntroduce a list with the appropriate context. In most cases, precede a list with an introductory sentence.\nThe sentence can end with a colon or a period; usually a colon if it immediately precedes the list, usually a period if there\u0026rsquo;s more material (such as a note paragraph) between the introduction and the list.\nIf the list doesn\u0026rsquo;t need any additional context other than the heading that immediately precedes the list, it\u0026rsquo;s OK to not introduce a list with an introductory sentence.\nIntroduce a list with a complete sentence, not a partial one that\u0026rsquo;s completed by the list items. You can also use the following as a noun phrase (see following in the word list).\nRecommended Use the Submit button for any of the following purposes:\nTo submit the form. To indicate that you\u0026rsquo;re done. To allow the next person to enter their data.

Placing your company\u0026rsquo;s brand identity at the forefront of your style guide is essential, serving as a constant reminder for the writer.\nAn excellent illustration of effective brand communication is demonstrated by Slack. They clearly outline their identity, values and all they represent.\nFigure 1. Slack\u0026rsquo;s brand identity\nWhile a solo writer may find this step less critical, it becomes crucial when collaborating with a team of writers. Ensuring everyone is aligned with the company\u0026rsquo;s brand fosters consistency in communication.\nUtilize an Existing Publishing Guide\nWhile you embark on creating your own guide, it\u0026rsquo;s worth remembering that guides have a rich history, and there\u0026rsquo;s no need to reinvent the wheel. Consider using an existing publishing guide as a starting point for crafting your own.\nChoose a guide that aligns with your specific requirements. For instance, if you\u0026rsquo;re working on technical documentation, opt for a APA Style guide. If you\u0026rsquo;re crafting an academic document, consider using the MLA handbook.\nVoice and Tone\nUnderstanding voice and tone is crucial, yet it can be misunderstood by many writers. Voice represents the personality of your writing, while tone sets the mood.\nVoice and Tone tip\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re composing a blog post about a new product, aim for a friendly voice and an excited tone.\nFor companies with diverse social media outlets for customer communication, maintaining a consistent voice and tone is essential. This consistency plays a key role in building trust with customers.\nWhen determining the tone and voice for your company, consider asking a few key questions:\nAre you aiming to be formal or informal? Do you prefer a friendly or professional tone? Is your style more serious or humorous? Answering these questions will guide you in making decisions about the tone and voice that best represent your company.\nAn exemplary case of a company effectively communicating its voice and tone is Mailchimp. They provide extensive details on how their company engages with customers.\nFigure 2. Mailchimps voice and tone\nGrammar and Punctuation\nHaving defined the voice and tone, it\u0026rsquo;s now time to delve into the finer details of your guide. Consistent rules regarding grammar and punctuation are essential; otherwise, your documentation may become confusing for your readers.\nWhen determining the grammar and punctuation rules for your company, consider asking a few questions:\nDo you want to use the Oxford comma? Are you inclined towards the serial comma? Is the em dash or en dash your preference? Given the multitude of standards in this area, refer to Shopify\u0026rsquo;s style guide for a comprehensive example. They provide clear explanations with numerous examples to illustrate their grammar and punctuation rules.\nFigure 3. Shopify\u0026rsquo;s grammar and punctuation\nIn your guide, be sure to provide examples for every point you make. This practice aids your writers in understanding the intended message and application of the guidelines.\nFormatting\nWhile many guides combine the formatting and grammar sections, I\u0026rsquo;ve chosen to separate them due to their distinct nature. Formatting pertains to how you present content to your readers. Consider questions like whether to use bold or italics, headings or subheadings, lists or tables, etc.\nWhen establishing formatting rules for your company, pose key questions to guide your decisions;\nDo you prefer using bold or italics for emphasis? What is your approach to using headings or subheadings? Are lists or tables the preferred format? Asking these questions will aid in defining the formatting style for your documentation.\nA notable example of effective documentation formatting can be found in the Google Developer Documentation Style Guide. This guide provides comprehensive rules for formatting, covering areas such as headings, titles, numbers, lists, tables, and more.\nFigure 4. Google Developer Documentation Style Guide formatting section\nTerminology and abbreviations\nTo create the terminology and abbreviations section, compile a comprehensive list of all terms and abbreviations specific to your company. This list guides writers in using the correct terms and abbreviations in documentation.\nWhen deciding on terminology and abbreviations, consider key questions:\nShould two-letter initialisms have periods? How do you introduce abbreviations? What significance do italics and abbreviations hold for your company? Answering these questions aids in making informed decisions for your style guide.\nA commendable example of incorporating terminology and abbreviations into documentation can be found in The 18F Content Guide. This guide provides insights into when to use abbreviations, how to introduce them, and more.\nFigure 5. 18F\u0026rsquo;s Content Guide terminology and abbreviations section\nImages and diagrams\nWhile many companies have a separate design style guide for visuals and media content, it\u0026rsquo;s crucial to include essential information on how writers source images.\nCertain questions need answers if writers are responsible for creating images or diagrams. For instance:\nWhat is the preferred image format? Are there specific preferred dimensions? Should all images include a brand logo? Addressing these questions will provide clarity for writers creating visual content.\nProviding guidance on producing images aligned with the company\u0026rsquo;s goals is essential for writers. DigitalOcean serves as an excellent example, effectively communicating necessary information about incorporating images into content.\nFigure 6. DigitalOcean\u0026rsquo;s image and assets style guide section\nNote\nStriking the right balance is crucial for a style guide—it shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be excessively long, diverting writers\u0026rsquo; focus and resulting in subpar documentation, nor should it be too short, leading to random filling of missing parts and conflicts in style. An optimal style guide typically spans three to five pages, offering sufficient, focused information for writers.\nCheck your knowledge:\nQuestion 1: All of the following are components of a style guide EXCEPT:\nVoice and tone Grammar and punctuation Typography Formatting guidelines Question 2: What does the section on \"Voice and Tone\" in a style guide address?\nRules for grammar and punctuation Choosing the right image format Establishing the company's brand Defining the personality and mood of writing Utilize a Template If you prefer not to start from scratch or are on a tight deadline to create a company style guide, consider using a template.\nTemplates serve as boilerplate guides where you can input your company\u0026rsquo;s information, including vision, mission, and all the necessary sections discussed above.\nWhile a quick Google search yields several style guide templates, Writers.com offers a particularly neat and recommended template.\nDownloading this template provides a solid starting point for creating your style guide.\nAlways keep in mind that consistency is the key to a good style guide. Adhere consistently to the standards and rules you adopt.\nWhy is it important for technical writers to have a writing style guide? The primary aim of a style guide is to enhance communication between the writer and the reader. With a well-defined style guide, writers can uphold consistency throughout their documents, thereby reducing the cognitive load on readers.\nBelow are few reasons why adopting a style guide is beneficial:\nEstablishing a distinct brand representation: Take popular blogs like MDN or DigitalOcean, for instance. You can quickly identify an article as theirs simply by observing the writing style. This is made possible by their adherence to a style guide, ensuring a consistent brand voice and tone.\nMDN Writing Style Guide Sample\nHow to add images and media\nTo add an image to a document, add your image file to the document\u0026rsquo;s folder, and then reference the image from within the document\u0026rsquo;s index.md file using Markdown image syntax or the equivalent HTML element.\nTo learn more about MDN writing style guide, visit MDN Web Docs.\nThis is crucial as it contributes to building trust with your readers. When readers trust you, they are more inclined to return for more content. This is particularly significant for technical writers aiming to establish a brand or companies seeking to cultivate a community around their product.\nMinimize readers\u0026rsquo; cognitive load: A style guide enables you to sustain consistency in your writing style, simplifying the understanding of your documentation for readers. Without a style guide, readers would need to invest more time deciphering your documentation due to inconsistency of content.\nThe longer it takes for readers to comprehend your documentation, the higher the likelihood they\u0026rsquo;ll leave. This is detrimental for your blog or company, as it translates to potential loss of subscribers or customers.\nSimplified editing process: A style guide streamlines the editing of your documentation for your editors. With a clear set of guidelines, they know exactly what to look for during the editing process. Without a style guide, editors would spend more time figuring out what needs editing.\nThe longer editors spend searching for useful information to edit your documentation, the greater the chance of making mistakes. These errors can have significant repercussions on the credibility of your documentation.\nSingle Source of Truth (SSOT): It serves as a centralized point of reference containing all information related to your documentation. SSOT encompasses grammar and punctuation rules, formatting guidelines, terminologies, abbreviations, as well as visual elements like images and diagrams.\nThe lack of a style guide means that your writers will invest more time figuring out how to format their documents. This is due to the absence of a trustworthy source containing all the necessary information for editing their documentation.\nPopular style guides and how to pick one for your project While you can create your own style guide (which we\u0026rsquo;ll discuss later), there are advantages to relying on an existing guide.\nUsing an existing style guide saves time since you don\u0026rsquo;t have to create one from scratch; you can simply choose one that fits your needs and start using it immediately.\nStyle guides are categorized based on the type of content they address. Examples include style guides for technical documentation, academic writing, open source documentation, and more.\nHere are details about some of the most popular style guides, aiding you in selecting the one suitable for your project.\n1.

Formatting covers a wide range of things, including font size, font selection, lists, indentation, margins, alignment, spacing, etc. Technical documents must be reader-centered.\nThe information should be explained and presented in a style that is readable and easy to understand. Formatting is one of the core elements of all technical documents.\nA format should show a hierarchical structure of information that guides the reader through the text.\nRegarding technical writing, ensuring that the document is reader-friendly and follows a clear organizational pattern is important.\nThink of it like visiting a friend\u0026rsquo;s apartment or going on vacation, where everything is in the wrong place. It can be frustrating and confusing to navigate through.\nSimilarly, if a technical document is not properly formatted, it can be difficult for readers to understand the content.\nCertain guidelines should be followed to write a well-formatted and reader-centered technical document.\nThe information should be presented in a style that is easy to read and understand. Formatting is one of the core elements of all technical documents, and it should show a hierarchical structure of information that guides the reader through the text.\nCommon formatting elements for technical documentation: The coming section explores Headings, Key Guidelines for Headings, and Levels Of Heading .\nHeadings Most technical articles and documents follow a particular hierarchy from introduction to conclusion. Often, the structure depends on the type of article or technical document.\nHeadings and subheadings are important elements of technical writing. They make your content more organized and help your readers navigate through what you have written.\nProper use of headings and subheadings increases the accessibility of your documents. One very important practice is writing descriptive and concise headings highlighting each section\u0026rsquo;s main idea\nHeadings are really important features in technical writing; they alert your readers about upcoming topics and subtopics and help readers skip and go to what they are interested in, in the case of long technical articles or documentation.\nIt can help you organize your content into large sections [major headings] and smaller sections [sub-headings]. Headings are formatted by level [first level, second level, third level], which can vary in position and formatting.\nAvoid using vague headings that do not convey any specific information. Headings should clearly state what your readers should expect from your content. Additionally, keywords in your headings help you optimize your technical document or article for search engines.\nKey Guidelines for Headings Always make your headings descriptive; using headings like ‘’Django plugins” does not convey the right message. Your headings should inform the reader of the content of each section.\nAlways make headings parallel in phrasing. This helps readers know if the sections are similar to the preceding ones. It is always best practice to use parallel construction to structure the phrases similarly. If one headline begins with a verb, all headlines should also begin with a verb. Example; “Conquer Your New Year\u0026rsquo;s Resolutions with These Simple Tips”\nEnsure that your headings maintain consistency. Use type size, style, color, italics, alignment, bold, etc. These guidelines can help you design headings effectively.\nFormat headings so that they indicate their level. Always use a hierarchical format when writing headings; generally, first-level headings are larger and bolder than second and subsequent-level headings.\nAlways use a consistent style of capitalization. Headings can be capitalized using several approaches. It is important to note that the same capitalization style should be used for each heading and each subheading within the document.\nLevels Of Heading First Level Headings The first level heading is the highest or main level heading. It is usually best practice for first-level headings to be the largest and should be bold.\nLevel Two Headings The second level heading is a subheading of Level 1. Second-level headings are usually smaller and different from first-level headings. When formatting, it’s usually best practice to indent the heading and align the subsequent blocks of text.\nLevel Three Headings Level 3 is the subheading of Level 2. Third-level headings are usually smaller than level-two headings. It should either be italicized or indented.\nExamples of Good and Bad Heading Good headlines help you draw attention to your audience. Headings are a quick way to capture people’s attention and encourage them to read more.\nExamples of good and bad headings to illustrate key principles.\nGood Headings “Introduction to Data Analysis” Indicates the main topic section\n“Key Benefits of Eating Balanced Diets” conveys the main points to be discussed\n“Methods for improving productivity as a student” Describes the section\u0026rsquo;s content and provides a clear focus\nBad Headings “Jewelry I found” Vague and lacks specificity, leaving readers uncertain about the content.\n“Chapter 1” Generic and Uninformative: readers can\u0026rsquo;t discern the content without more context\n“Random Stuffs” Similar to “Random Facts”, it lacks specificity and doesn’t guide the reader\nThe coming section explores list, Guidelines for Creating Lists in Technical Writing, and List Types .\nList In technical writing, it is important to convey information clearly and concisely. Using lists while writing can be a helpful tool in highlighting important points, properly structuring your paragraphs and sentences, and organizing your document.\nListing in technical writing can make a technical document more readable and simplified. Even with formatting a list correctly, your articles could be clearer to your readers. It is important to understand how to format a list properly.\nGuidelines for Creating Lists in Technical Writing Do not split a list over two pages; try as much as possible to ensure the list stays on one page.\nTry not to overuse lists; most importantly, a list should have complementary explanatory text to add more information about the list and its importance.\nEnsure that the first letter of each of the list items is capitalized.\nAt least 2-8 items should be included in a list; ensure that you have at least two items in a list, or it might not be considered a list. Also, having more than 8 items in a list is too much; if the information can be merged, it will make it readable and well formatted.\nAdd spacing to the list to enhance the readability of the technical documents.\nAlways use parallel phrasing / parallel construction.\nList Types Just as different items in a kitchen have different purposes, different kinds of lists also serve different purposes. In this section, we will look at five commonly used types of lists.\n1. Bullet List Bullet lists are the most commonly used type of list. They typically emphasize two or more items when a specific order is unimportant.\nBullet lists can also add whitespace to a document to improve readability. However, they are generally short and should not be used for items longer than a few words.\nExamples of how bullet lists can be used: To list the ingredients for a recipe To outline the steps in a procedure To summarize the key points of a presentation, To create a checklist of tasks 2. Numbered List Numbered lists should be used when the order of the listed items is important, and ideas must be expressed in chronological order.\nFor example, numbered lists often provide instructions, outline steps in a process, or present a sequence of events. Use of numbered lists helps convey a sense of order and progression, making it easier for readers to follow the presented information. Here is a simple, numbered list providing a clear and concise set of instructions on baking cookies\nGather the necessary ingredients. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit. Combine the dry ingredients in a large bowl. In a separate bowl, cream the butter and sugar together. Beat in the eggs one at a time. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until combined. Stir in the vanilla extract. Drop rounded tablespoons onto ungreased baking sheets. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until golden brown. cool on baking sheets for a few minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely. For optimal clarity, strive to keep your numbered lists within eight items. Consider dividing your list into stages or phases if it exceeds eight items.\nSubsequently, review your documents and check for formatting to enhance readability.\n3. In-sentence lists Sentence lists are typically employed when you have only two to four items and desire to preserve sentence structure and paragraphing. For instance, you could utilize a sentence list to list the ingredients for a simple recipe or the key points of a brief presentation.\nExample of a sentence list:\nThe ingredients for this recipe are flour, sugar, eggs, and milk. The key points of my presentation are the importance of communication, teamwork, and adaptability. As you can see, sentence lists allow you to maintain a cohesive flow while presenting a short list of items. 4. Labeled lists Are employed when the listed items require further explanation or elaboration. For instance, you could utilize a labeled list to define key terms or outline the steps involved in a complex process.\nExample of a labeled list:\nComponents of a Computer: Hardware: the physical components of a computer, such as the CPU, RAM, and hard drive. Software: The programs that enable a computer to function, such as the operating system and application software. As you can see, labeled lists provide a clear and structured way to present information that requires additional explanation.\nNested Lists Nested lists are commonly used when list items have sub-lists, which are lists within a larger list. This structure can help organize and present complex information, particularly when hierarchical relationships between the items exist.\nExample of a nested list:\nFruit\nCitrus\nOrange\nLemon\nGrapefruit\nBerries\nRaspberry\nStrawberry\nBlueberry\nTropical\nMango\nPineapple\nBanana\nLists are crucial features of technical writing. They enhance readability, improve clarity, and ensure that ideas are conveyed accurately and effectively.\nIt break down complex information into digestible chunks, making it easier for readers to grasp and retain key points. They also help to organize and structure content, creating a logical flow that guides the reader through the material.\nThe coming section explores tables, steps to prepare tables in a technical document, and formatting guidelines for creating tables .\nTables A table is a structured arrangement of rows and columns that presents information in a tabular format. It is often used to present selection, comparison, or study information.\nWell-designed tables in technical writing can make information clear and readable and create a visual representation of results, making them more concise and organized.\nTables predominantly present numerical data, such as comparing characteristics like height and depth or listing product prices.\nTables do make it easy to compare information. It can show trends or patterns of increasing or decreasing activity.\nSteps to Prepare Tables in a Technical Document Identify your audience\nWrite a clear outline\nCreate a template for your table\nDesign the Table Layout\nDetermine the Number of Columns Required\nSelect appropriate cell borders\nChoose an appropriate font style that will be used across the documents\nAdd text elements\nThe following guidelines will help you to create and format tables efficiently;\nFormatting Guidelines for Creating Tables Each column in a table should be properly labeled with a meaningful header.\nA table cell should not hold more than two sentences\nIntroduce each table with a sentence that tells the readers what the list or table represents.\nAlways use parallelism within individual columns.\nThe data in the table should be properly explained so that readers don’t find it difficult to understand.\nTables should be simplified to the amount of data that illustrates your point.\nA footnote proves useful for elaborating on specific aspects of one or more items in the table rather than cluttering the table with excessive information.\nAlways include enough data to illustrate your point without misrepresenting it.\nAn example of a table with appropriate introductory text and format\nTable 1: The following table identifies States and Capitals in Nigeria and Their Slogans with Current Governor S/N State Capital Slogan Current Governor 01 Abia Umuahia God’s Own State Alex Otti 02 Adamawa Yola Land of Beauty Ahmadu Umaru Fintiri 03 Akwa - Ibom Uyo Land of Promise Umo Eno In summary, tables should be introduced and referenced in the text beforehand. They should be numbered sequentially and have concise, descriptive, and easy-to-understand captions.\nCheck your knowledge:\nQuestion 1: All of these are steps to prepare tables in a Technical Document except?\nIdentify your audience Write a clear outline. Create a template for your table. Do not number your table Question 2: Which of these is the most commonly used type of list?\nNumbered list Bullet list In-sentence list Labeled list The coming section explores figures, key guidelines for figures, and types of figures in technical writing .\nFigures A figure can be considered any visual element or presentation incorporated into a technical document. Figures can encompass photographs, sketches, schematics, line graphs, and various other forms of visual representation.\nIn most instances, figures present data clearly and concisely. When the need arises to convey quantitative information in a visually appealing way, figures should be employed to enhance the reader\u0026rsquo;s understanding and comprehension.\nFigures should be simple and clear; avoid adding borders, grid lines, background patterns, and 3-D effects.\nKey Guidelines for Figures Figures should exhibit high-quality image resolution, ensuring clarity and visual appeal.\nEach figure in a technical report should be assigned a unique identifier, enabling seamless referencing throughout the document.\nFigure 3.4.2 Sales Strategy for three demo projects about to be launched\nExamine Figure 3.4.2 has a unique identifier for easy reference.\nAll figure elements, including labels, captions, and legends, should incorporate a combination of letters and numbers to ensure unambiguous identification and reference throughout the technical document.\nFigures should be simplified and explanatory, enhancing the clarity and comprehension of the presented information.\nAvoid using overly complex or intricate figures that may obscure the intended message. Instead, opt for clear, concise, and well-organized figures that effectively convey the intended information to the reader.\nUtilize contemporary tools to produce engaging visuals that improve technical writing. Take advantage of the features of Microsoft Office and other specialized software to design graphics that are visually attractive but also informative and efficient in communicating intricate technical ideas.\nAdd a clear, concise, and descriptive image description, and include all necessary information.\nTake a close look at Figure 3.5.2 below. Do you understand what information it conveys?\nFigure 3.5.2\nIf you take a closer look at Figure 3.5.2, you can interpret the image. However, the lack of a descriptive caption makes it difficult to be certain.\nFigure 3.5.3 A Budget Bar Chart showing the percentage of T-shirt sales\nFigure 3.5.3 has a numbered caption and a descriptive title. With this added information, the reader will have a clearer and more informative view of the figure.\nTypes of Figures There are many types of figures in technical writing, including but not limited to.\nDiagrams: They are often used to represent a model or an object. These images can be manually designed or drawn using computer software. Diagrams represent objects such as buildings, vehicles, and tools.\nFlow Chart: They are visual representations used to document and design processes or programs. It is also a pictorial representation of a process in sequential order.\nPie Chart: They are graphics often used to communicate varying percentages or values to each other.\nHistogram: A histogram is a graphical representation that organizes a group of data points into user-specified ranges.\nThe coming section explores Images, General Guidelines to Consider While Adding an Image to a Technical Document, and Pictures in Documentation; “The What and What not” .\nImages As a technical writer, you aim to craft clear, understandable, and readable documents. The goal is to provide your readers with the best possible assistance for using a product.\nOne excellent way to achieve this is by incorporating images into your writing. These images may include photos, screenshots, graphics, and illustrations. It improve content clarity, particularly when writing installation guides, instruction manuals, or introducing new products.\nIncorporating screenshots of the process enhances clarity and comprehension when crafting technical documents, such as user manuals, how-to guides, or release notes.\nWhen guiding a user to use a new application, it is important to ensure the instructions are clear and easy to understand. One effective way to achieve this is using images to support the text.\nOutlining the steps without an image might not be as descriptive and understandable as one with an image. Images can help users visualize what they are expected to do, making it easier to follow the instructions.\nExample 1 To seamlessly utilize this app, follow these steps:\nNavigating the Home Screen: The initial screen presents various sections allowing you to select a class based on your preferred subject.

Images make the content easier to understand, and they aid in the speed at which the information presented is processed.\nIt also makes complex documentation clear and concise. How and where you will use images in your documentation depends on many elements.\nIndeed, images and illustrations can greatly enhance the clarity and understanding of technical documentation.\nHowever, it is important to note that there may be restrictions on using images in certain technical documents, particularly if they contain sensitive or confidential information.\nCreating professional-quality images for technical documentation often requires specialized tools and expertise that may only be available to some.\nTranslating illustrations can be costly, so it is important to carefully consider the need for images before incorporating them into a technical document.\nGeneral Guidelines to Consider While Adding an Image to a Technical Document The following guidelines are best practices for adding an image to your article.\nThe image included should be relevant to the steps you are trying to clarify.\nEnsure you add a description and reference an image before its placement.\nAlways use appropriate and descriptive captions and labels\nAlways credit image owners and use an image containing copyrighted information\nAlways add clear images, especially while adding screenshots, either in a technical manual or release note; endeavor to use a screenshotting tool to get good screenshots.\nPictures in Documentation; “The What and What not” Best Practices for Adding Images to Technical Documentation\nImages are an essential part of technical documentation, as they can help illustrate complex concepts or procedures and provide additional information that may not be easily conveyed through text.\nSome best practices for adding images to technical documentation:\nChoose the right image format: When selecting an image format, consider the type of image you are working with and its intended use. Common image formats in technical documentation include JPEG, PNG, and GIF. JPEGs are best for photographs, while PNGs and GIFs are better suited for screenshots or diagrams.\nOptimize image size and resolution: Keep image sizes as small as possible without compromising quality. Large images can slow down the loading time of online documentation, while overly compressed images can affect their clarity and readability. As a general rule of thumb, aim for a resolution of 72 dpi for web-based documentation and 300 dpi for print.\nUse descriptive image titles and alt text: Provide descriptive titles for images that accurately reflect their contents. This can help users quickly identify the image\u0026rsquo;s purpose and relevance. Additionally, provide alternative text (alt text) for each image to ensure accessibility for visually impaired users.\nPlace images near relevant text: Place them near the relevant text or instructions they illustrate to ensure that images are helpful and not confusing. This will help users understand the relationship between the image and the text and avoid confusion.\nLabel images clearly: Use labels or captions to provide additional context or information about an image. For example, if you use a screenshot to illustrate a process, label each step with a descriptive caption.\nUse consistent formatting: To ensure consistency throughout your documentation, use the same formatting for all images. This includes size, resolution, and placement.\nHow to use formatting to improve the readability and clarity of your technical documentation Readability is simply communicating ideas in a clear and accessible way.\nConsistency is very important in technical writing. You should use uniform styles, sizes, and formats for all elements to make your document easy to read and understand. Creating a hierarchy with fonts, colors, and alignment is also crucial in technical writing. It helps readers quickly scan the document and find the necessary information.\nAnother important thing you should consider is your audience. Always tailor your content to your readers and understand who you\u0026rsquo;re writing for. This will help you determine the appropriate language, tone, and level of technicality to use in your document.\nOrganizing your content in a hierarchical format is also essential. Creating an outline is a key tool for organization in technical writing. It helps you to organize your content and create an easier user experience for your readers.\nFinally, simplicity is key in technical writing. Always use clear and straightforward language and write short sentences. This will help you convey your information concisely and ensure your readers can easily understand your content.\nExercise:\nComplete the following exercises before procedding to the next module.\nWrite a blog post incorporating the different formatting techniques discussed in this module.\nconsider:\nSentence length and structure: Are the sentences concise and varied?\nParagraph structure: Are the paragraphs focused and well-organized?\nHeadings and subheadings: Are they used effectively to break up the text and guide the reader?\nBullet points and numbered lists: Are they used appropriately for clarity and conciseness?\nImages and other visuals: Are they relevant and well-placed?\nCall to action: Does the post end with a clear call to action for the reader?\nAfter review, tag @TechnicalWriti6 on X(Twitter with the link to you published submission.)\nAnswer the following questions.

In data science, well-placed annotations in process flow diagrams highlight critical steps, aiding data scientists in understanding and optimizing workflows.\nFigure 3. Data flow diagram displaying proper use of labels\n4. Align with Audience Expectations: Tailor your diagrams to your audience. In network security, align a network topology diagram with security professionals\u0026rsquo; expectations. Highlight security layers, emphasize attack vectors, and use familiar conventions for effective communication.\n5. Utilize Visual Hierarchy: Guide the reader\u0026rsquo;s eye with visual hierarchy. In plain diagrams explaining conceptual ideas, use size, color, or placement to emphasize key elements. This enhances understanding, whether illustrating a decision-making process or showcasing relationships between concepts.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s not just about creating a diagram but creating one that works. Keep it simple, consistent, and aligned with your audience\u0026rsquo;s needs. Your diagrams, when simple and aligned, become powerful tools for communication in any technical domain. Embrace the visual language, and let your diagrams tell a compelling story!\nDo\u0026rsquo;s and Don\u0026rsquo;ts for effective technical diagrams As with any concept, usage rules apply. Consider the following when creating diagrams for technical documentation:\nDo\u0026rsquo;s for Using Images in Technical Documentation:\nUtilize alt text: Include descriptive alt text for images. This boosts SEO and ensures accessibility for screen reader users, enhancing inclusivity.\nThe following is an example of alt text in markdown:\n1![alt text](/path/to/image.png)\rFigure descriptions: Accompany images with clear figure descriptions. This helps readers, especially in scenarios like network security diagrams.\nThe following is an example of a figure description in markdown:\n1Figure [NUMBER]. [DESCRIPTION]\rGive credit: Provide proper attribution when using images created by others. This maintains ethical standards in content creation, crucial in web development.\nThe following is an example of image attribution in markdown:\n1![alt text](/path/to/image.png) 2Figure [NUMBER]. [DESCRIPTION] 3Image source: [SOURCE]\rOr you can give credit in the figure description:\n1Figure [NUMBER]. [Image source] from [image author]\rHigh resolution: Maintain high-quality images for clear and legible details, benefiting both technical writers and developers.\nUnified formats: Stick to consistent image formats for a polished look. Whether you\u0026rsquo;re a technical writer or developer, using a unified format enhances professionalism and readability.\nCheck your knowledge:\nQuestion 1: As a technical writer creating diagrams, I should do the following EXCEPT:\nUse consistent design elements Use poor quality images Utilize alt text for images Provide high-resolution images Question 2: Why is it important to give proper attribution when using images created by others in technical documentation?\nIt has no impact on ethical standards It ensures exclusivity for image creators It maintains ethical standards in content creation It increases confusion for readers Don\u0026rsquo;ts for Using Images in Technical Documentation:\nAvoid overcomplicating images: Steer clear of overwhelming your audience with overly complex images. Whether you\u0026rsquo;re a developer illustrating code architecture or a technical writer creating process flow diagrams, prioritize simplicity. Avoid unnecessary details that might confuse rather than clarify.\nAvoid unclear figure descriptions: Ensure figure descriptions are clear and concise. Technical writers and editors should provide enough information for readers to understand the image\u0026rsquo;s relevance. Ambiguous descriptions can lead to misinterpretation.\nAvoid including personal information: Be cautious not to include personal information in diagrams or screenshots, especially when showcasing your codebase. Prevent exposing sensitive information to the public.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t Neglect Consistency in Style: Maintain a consistent style throughout your technical diagrams. Whether you\u0026rsquo;re a developer illustrating system interactions or a technical writer creating documentation, inconsistency in style can lead to confusion. Stick to a unified design language to ensure a cohesive and professional appearance across all your visual elements.\nExercise\nComplete the following exercises before procedding to the next module.\nNavigate to the Technical Writers Mentorship Program YouTube page and complete the following exercises:\nWatch the Introduction to Git and Github part 1 \u0026amp; 2 videos.

Identify the Goal: Identify the primary goal of your document. Are you informing, instructing, or persuading your audience? Your goal will determine the structure and tone of your document.\n2. Define The Outcome: After reading your document, what should your user be able to do? Would you want them to be able to implement a specific Technology? Or would you want them to understand a complex concept? Or do you want them to be able to make an informed decision based on the information gained from your document?\n3. Content Scope: With your goal and outcome clearly defined, you can draft out the scope of your document\u0026rsquo;s content based on the technical background of your audience. What information should your audience have already, and what information do you want them to gain from your document?\nFormula for a good documentation\nAccording to Google’s Technical Writing course:\nA Good documentation = knowledge and skills your audience needs to do a task − your audience's current knowledge and skills\nAligning your information gathering with your document\u0026rsquo;s purpose ensures your technical document\u0026rsquo;s relevance and effectiveness.\nIdentify your sources of information The scope of your documentation will determine the sources you can gather information.\nThere are various information sources, each having its unique strengths and limitations.\nHere are some key sources of information:\n1. Subject Matter Experts (SMEs): A subject-matter expert is a person with deep knowledge, experience, and prowess in a particular field called \u0026ldquo;the subject\u0026rdquo;. They are a valuable and reliable source for:\nAccurate and insightful information, Best practices, and Everyday solutions to real-world problems, etc. Within that subject/field. You can get information from SMEs through:\nInterviews, Meetings, and Consultations. Apart from being a source of valuable information, SMEs can also help validate the accuracy and relevance of your content.\nHere are some helpful tips when engaging with an SME:\nAsk open-ended questions. This way, you are giving the expert room to provide detailed explanations. Follow up the discussion with a summary of your thoughts to be sure you didn\u0026rsquo;t miss anything and confirm you got everything right. Build a collaboration with the SMEs to help with future support and review. 2. Technical Documentation: Technical documentation is a document that provides instructions, explanations, and reference materials for a specific technical product, system, or process. It helps you understand how to use, debug, and learn more about the technical subject matter.\nYou can refer to already existing technical documentation that is current and relevant to your subject matter, such as:\nUser guides, White papers, API documentation, Research Papers, Technical Specifications, Glossary of Terms, FAQs, etc. While gathering information from these sources, a good practice is to cross-reference across multiple documents to verify the consistency of information.\nYou can always use Technical documents as a starting point and then complement their information with other sources, such as SMEs, as discussed above.\n3. Industry Publications and Blogs: You can also get valuable information from credible industry publications and blogs to supplement your content.\nWhen extracting information from this source, here are a few things to note:\nEnsure that the authors of these publications are from reliable sources. Remember that most blogs and publications reflect the trends and state of the art at the time of publication. Use this to assess the relevance of the information to your document\u0026rsquo;s objective. Blogs mostly reflect people’s personal opinions and experiences; you can always verify and cross-reference these different views to have a balanced perspective in your writing. 4. Online Forums and Communities: Online forums and communities relating to your Subject matter are great places to get different opinions from fellow community members on real-life experiences, fixes to common challenges, and feedback.\nYou can also get to ask questions and gather insights from community members. Again, you should verify the credibility of the information before using it to supplement your document.\n5. Additional Sources of Information: Other sources of information include but are not limited to:\nSocial Media and Podcasts, Competitor Analysis, User Feedback and Reviews, Tutorial Videos, etc. Always verify the credibility of the information obtained from these sources and cross-reference them to get reliable and accurate content.\nTaking a deeper approach to gathering information from various sources can significantly increase the quality and credibility of your technical writing.\nCheck your knowledge:\nQuestion 1: Which of the following is NOT a recommended source of information for technical writing?\nSubject matter experts (SMEs) User forums with anonymous contributors White papers from reputable organizations Question 2: What are the two key factors to consider when defining your audience for a technical document?\nThe writer's expertise and interests. The document's length and complexity. The audience's technical knowledge and expectations. Develop a research plan You can maximize your information-gathering process by developing a research plan. Your research plan should generally have:\nThe Document\u0026rsquo;s objective, Information Sources, Timelines and Deadlines. Setting Clear Objectives 1. Be Specific: Clearly outline the goals and objectives of your technical document by answering the question: \u0026ldquo;What specific information(s) do you want to deliver to your audience?\u0026rdquo; This will serve as a roadmap in your information-gathering process.\nAn example of a general and specific goal:\n1 General goal: 2 3 Understanding Programming Principles\r1 Targeted goal: 2 3 Understanding SOLID principle in Kotlin\rThis way, you have mapped out what software principle and programming language you will show examples.\n2. Prioritize: Based on your audience analysis, you can prioritize what topics are most important, thus focusing your research efforts on areas that will have the greatest impact on your audience. In our previous example: “Understanding SOLID principle in Kotlin”, you don\u0026rsquo;t need to research what Kotlin programming language is and its history because your audience is expected to be already familiar with Kotlin programming language.\n3. Use the Question-Driven Approach: Create specific questions that your audience should be able to answer after reading your document. This will act as a guide and help your technical document to stay focused and relevant.\nTime Management 1. Set Deadlines: Break down your research process into different phases and allocate realistic deadlines for each phase.\n2. Balance Depth and Breadth: From your audience analysis, allocate time based on how important and complex a topic is.\n3. Schedule Reviews: Have review sessions to assess your progress against the roadmap and timelines you set and make adjustments when needed.\nGather Information After creating a research plan, the next step will be to gather information from the various sources you mentioned in your research plan.\nThere are various methods and techniques you can employ when gathering information, some of which are:\n1. Systematic Data Collection: i. Follow your Research Plan: Your research plan already includes the goal of your document, the specific topics you would cover, and the questions your document should answer. Follow these systematically, collecting information according to them. This will help you stay organized and on track, ensuring you cover all the necessary areas.\nii. Adapt: Information is always evolving, so be prepared to alter your research plan as new information emerges.\niii. Have a Documentation Strategy: There are various ways of documenting your findings. Choose one and stay consistent with it. This will make it easier and quicker to recover and reference information later.\n2. Note-Taking and Organization i. Effective Note-Taking Techniques: Implementing the Cornell method or mind mapping can make your note-taking process more efficient. You can even choose to combine them, whichever works best for you. This will help you in documenting and retrieving information effectively.\nii. Categorization and Tagging: Using categories, tags, or labels to organize your notes will make it easier to find information, identify knowledge gaps, and connect information.\n3. Cross-verification and Fact-Checking Cross-verification confirms the accuracy of information obtained from a particular source by comparing it with different sources.\nIt is best practice to cross-verify your information to ensure consistency and highlight inconsistent areas for further research and investigation. When in doubt, you can also contact SMEs for further clarification.\nThis can help resolve ambiguities and ensure the accuracy of your information.\n4. Active Learning When writing about software or a tool, use them yourself and try out different use cases or scenarios with them.\nThis will give you firsthand experience and a deeper understanding of the subject, which will help you to write valuable insights that supersede theoretical research.\nDoing this may expose you to questions and challenges your audience might face.\nEvaluate and synthesize the information you have gathered. Information Evaluation After gathering information for your technical document, you must read through the technical document and critically analyze its:\n1. Accuracy and Credibility: By ensuring the information is correct, reliable, current, and error and bias free. Also, evaluate that your information source is reliable, from an expert, or a reputable publication.\n2. Relevance: Confirm that the information answers the questions you stated your document should answer in your Research Plan. This ensures that your document satisfies its purpose and objectives and is suitable for your audience. You can remove irrelevant information from your writing to maintain the focus of the writing.\nSynthesize your Data: After evaluating, you must organize your technical writing in a logical and orderly manner that is easy to read through and understand. You can do this by:\n1. Connecting the Dots: Identify the key themes and concepts and extract the central and unifying ideas. Look beyond the individual bits of information but see how they relate. One way to do this is by linking theoretical concepts with their real-world application or comparing the new technology with a technology your audience is familiar with.\n2. Organize the information into a logical structure: Structure your document so that each piece builds to the next. Highlight important points and findings while ensuring an uninterrupted flow of information in your document. Identifying repeating concepts in your documents can help you structure complex information in an easy-to-understand way.\n3. Storytelling and Engagement Strategies: An example of a storytelling approach is relating abstract concepts in your document to physical, relatable things or systems. Including real-world examples or hypothetical scenarios to illustrate important points will also help to make your document more engaging.\nReview and revise your information. The final step in information gathering is to review and revise your document to ensure that it is:\nClear, Concise, and free of unnecessary details. Based on facts and not personal opinions. Consistent and complete, having all the information that satisfies the purpose and objective of the document. Here are some review techniques you can employ:\n1. Self-Review You should read through your technical document as a first-time user and assess technical terms\u0026rsquo; logical progression and accuracy. Look for complex terms and sentences that can be simplified too.\nAlso, try to answer the questions you listed when setting your document\u0026rsquo;s goals and objectives to ensure your writing is relevant.\n2. Peer Review Share your technical document with peers that suit your audience description or SMEs for review and feedback. While doing this, you can make specific feedback requests by asking your reviewers how engaging or clear your technical document is to get more focused and useful feedback. You can make specific feedback requests by asking your reviewers how engaging or clear your technical document is to get more focused and useful feedback.\nYou can also ask them if your document answers the questions you listed when setting the goals and objectives to ensure that it is relevant. To get a thorough view of your document\u0026rsquo;s effectiveness, you can share it with reviewers having different perspectives or expertise levels.\nMake sure to address any gaps or inconsistencies identified during the review process, boosting the quality of your technical document.\n3. Incorporating Feedback and Revision: Analyze the feedback from your reviewers to determine which feedback will be implemented and revise your document based on this.\nYou can employ a revision strategy. An example may be addressing vital structural changes before moving to more detailed grammar changes.\nWhile analyzing and incorporating feedback, keep track of the changes you have made in case you need to revisit previous versions.\n4. Consistency Check and Final Proofreading Pay attention to the voice and style of your writing and ensure that you are adhering to a specific style guide like APA, MLA, or Google’s writing style guide.\nEnsure that the format for the headings, lists, etc in your document is consistent throughout the document.\nWhen proofreading, be on the lookout for grammatical errors and typos. You can use Grammar checkers, but be careful not to rely entirely on them.\n5. Practical Testing and Validation If your technical document includes hands-on instructions or coding, follow through with them yourself to ensure they work as expected.\nYou can also have your peer reviewers test the hands-on instructions or coding to be sure it\u0026rsquo;s simple and easy to follow.\nBe ready to revise the document, as this may reveal issues you might not have anticipated.\nComplete the following exercises before proceeding to the next module.\nExercise: Develop a Research Plan Objective In this exercise, you will practice your knowledge in information gathering and research on an emerging technology relevant to your field.\nInstructions: 1. Choose an Emerging Technology: Select a technology within your field of expertise that is still in its early stages of development but has the potential for significant impact. Ensure it is a topic that requires gathering information from various sources.\n2. Define Your Audience and Purpose: Clearly identify your target audience for the technical document: Determine who would benefit most from understanding this technology. Consider factors like existing knowledge, potential applications, and decision-making power. Define the purpose of your document - whether it is to inform, instruct, or persuade. 3. Research Sources: Identify at least four different sources of information for your chosen topic. These can include SMEs, technical documentation, industry publications, online forums, etc. Explain why each source is relevant and how it will contribute to the overall understanding of the topic. 4. Develop a Research Plan: Clearly outline the goals and objectives of your technical document. Prioritize the topics based on their importance to your audience. Formulate at least five specific questions that your document should answer. 5. Time Management: Break down your research process into different phases. Set realistic deadlines for each phase. Balance the depth and breadth of your research, allocating time based on the importance and complexity of each topic. 6. Gather Information: Use systematic data collection methods following your research plan. Implement any effective note-taking technique (Cornell method, mind mapping, etc.). Cross-verify information obtained from different sources for consistency. 7. Evaluate and Synthesize Information: Evaluate the accuracy, credibility, and relevance of the information gathered. Organize the information into a logical structure, identifying key themes and concepts. 8. Review and Revise: Conduct a self-review of your technical document.

The concept of writing for User Experience (UX).\nModule content\nThis module contains the following;\nWhat is user experience (UX)? Why is UX important for technical writing? What are UX principles? How to write user-friendly technical documentation. User experience, otherwise known as UX, is used to describe the emotional sentiment of an individual when they use a product. This product can be of any form - physical or digital.\nIt is also the sum of techniques employed by design and developer teams to make a product easy to use by the target audience.\nUX is concerned with how the user (the reader in this context) can use the product according to its functionalities to fulfill their tasks, how well they understand its unique capabilities, and whether they have an overall pleasant experience.\nThere are common misconceptions attached to writing for user experience. This module will discuss them to clarify doubts with detailed explanations.\nThe first is this:: user experience (UX) and user interface (UI) are the same.\nUser experience (UX) is often and wrongly interchanged with the user interface (UI). Although both concepts complement each other, they have different components and, therefore, can not be used in place of one another.\nThe user interface (UI) is the part of the product where the user can see, touch, and interact.\nThe second is this: writing for user experience and UX writing are the same.\nThis is untrue; here’s why. Writing for user experience is aimed at creating content that improves the usability of products for users, while UX writing is the written aspect of user interface design.\nFigure 2. Understanding user satisfaction in technical writing.\nIt involves crafting words, phrases, and sentences to fit a user interface. It is meant to make text clear, readable, concise, and user-friendly.\nThese concepts, user interface (UI), user experience (UX), and writing for user experience have one goal in common: user satisfaction.\nNow that you understand the meaning of user experience, let us learn why it is important for technical writing.\nWhy is UX important for technical writing? Technical writing involves creating specialized content to convey information about a product to its prospective and continuous users.\nTechnical writing can be found in virtually every field, from medicine, telecommunication, sports, and media to software development.\nTechnical writers are adequately trained to curate content with the key terms of each field they specialize in.\nNote\nThe role of a technical writer can be likened to the function of a bridge. This person connectsvthe user and the product.\nIf the content created by the technical writer concerning a product does not explain all of its features, the user might not use the product properly.\nIt also takes away the anticipated consumer satisfaction and reduces their productivity.\nJudging from the sensitive position of a technical writer, it is important to prepare written content so that users can understand and adequately describe the product’s features. This is where writing for user experience comes in.\nWriting for user experience is applying UX principles when curating written content. For instance, most software development tools and frameworks have steep learning curves and can be tasking, even for users with knowledge of similar products.\nThe technical writer\u0026rsquo;s role is to ensure they apply all the UX principles necessary while creating clear and concise documentation for users.\nWhat are these UX Principles? As with UX design, UX principles are a set of instructions that designers use to create products for users with the aim of ease of use and positive experiences.\nThere are a lot of UX principles, and this module will discuss them in the context of technical writing.\nThese are some UX principles.\nAccessibility This is a means of designing products users can access despite their disabilities.In technical writing, this means that written content should be made accessible for all readers, despite their disabilities.\nIt is not advisable to assume all product users are free from neurological and physical impairments.\nWriting for accessibility can be achieved by splitting large paragraphs and adding diagrams and charts. Alternative texts should be included in images for description. Link texts should carry meaningful information.\nAudio content in form of transcripts can be added at the top of content pages. Captions should be added to enhance multimedia identification.\nConsistency As with popular brands, they can be associated with a particular slogan or color. A particular thing comes to mind whenever you hear or think of that brand. This is possible because the brand has created associated traits for themselves.\nNote\nFor example, Docker has the image of a whale carrying a stack of containers on its way to customers, closely related to their services. This can be found on their website, blog, documentation and social media pages. This way, whenever a reader sees their logo, their mind instantly thinks of Docker.\nConsistency is maintaining the language, feel, and look of written content for a product across different marketing channels, on the website, blog, and official documentation.\nIt can be achieved by maintaining using a style guide. An ideal publication or company has a unique style guide that tells its technical writers how to construct their official documentation and other related documents.\nThis covers all aspects of written content, from grammar and composition, use of pronouns, addition of backlinks, SEO optimization, and others. A style guide prevents a disruption in the flow of content transmission, especially with the change of writers. A popular example of one is Google\u0026rsquo;s writing style guide.\nUsability As it sounds, the usability of a product is ranked on how easy users find it to use. In technical writing, it refers to written content that can be understood and implemented by all product users, old and new.\nUsability can be achieved by testing already written content on brand-new users and noting their reactions and the rate of their learning curves. It can also be improved by conducting anonymous surveys, correcting loopholes, and permitting open-source contributions for users.\nHierarchy Hierarchy is the methodical arrangement of written content to suit an acceptable narrative. We know that when we pick up a book, the first word or phrase we expect to see is the title, followed by the author\u0026rsquo;s name.\nAfter that, the table of contents follows, then the main content/body of the content. Technical writing is a vast space as it covers proposals, white papers, tutorials, SDKs, and API documentation, all of which have different approaches.\nThe technical writer can achieve hierarchy with written content by writing it according to its requirements or outline.\nNote\nFor example, if you were to write a tutorial, you would write a title, add a cover image and prerequisites needed by the reader, and then the main body of the tutorial, assisted by visual aids to ensure they are on the right track.\nThe writer would add headings and sub-headings as needed (from h1-h5), bullet points, numerical or alphabetical lists for key points, and adequate paragraph spacing to make the content easy to read.\nContext This is an important principle that cuts across different sectors aside from technical writing. By creating documentation within context, users have access to specific information related to the concepts of a particular product.\nNote\nIf a product caters to users with macOS and iOS devices and gadgets, writing troubleshooting guides and user guides that include Android and Linux-based devices may not be useful to the users.\nFindability This is the ease at which a specific piece of information can be found in written content so that users can easily find what they want using a search bar or keywords.\nFindability can be achieved by implementing hierarchy and information architecture to aid ease of use. Headings segment the content and make in-content searches easy to carry out.\nCheck your knowledge:\nQuestion 1: ______ is the sum of techniques design and developer teams use to make products easy for consumers to use. Usability Consumer protection User experience Question 2: Which of these is not an element of typographical emphasis?\nfull stop backtick strikethrough Up next: writing user-friendly technical documentation!\nHow to Write User-Friendly Technical Documentation There are several ways to create user-friendly documentation. These steps are as follows:\nKnow Your Audience Figure 3. Know your audience before creating content.\nBefore creating content for users, it is important to research the background of the users. For example, tutorials for new users would differ from those curated for existing product users.\nTutorials for new users can be tagged “beginner guides”, such as “a beginner’s guide to creating Kubernetes clusters”, “everything you need to know about using headless CMS platforms”,“how to migrate from x to y as a newbie”, and similar titles.\nAs they are named, they should provide detailed information, carefully explain concepts, and name all the prerequisites for the user to follow the tutorial properly.\nExisting users with some experience with the product in question would not need to be coddled so much. Explaining concepts they are familiar with would only bore them, but adding prerequisites, visual aids, and aids for troubleshooting issues is still necessary.\nIt is necessary to apply tact when choosing how to write for your audience, as a single misstep can cause user dissatisfaction. This eludes the aim of catering towards a positive user experience.\nImplement Information Architecture Figure 4. Implement information architecture while creating technical written content.\nInformation architecture is the process of organizing written content for ease of use and navigation. It can be implemented by making optimal use of white space.\nThis prevents the content from looking clumped and bulky. Readers often lose interest in written content when it looks bulky, as it plants a notion they would not finish.\nAlso, with the advent of information being delivered at very short intervals, lengthy sentences and paragraphs tend to receive less positive treatment. Arrange your content accordingly in a manner that permits easy navigation. An easy way to do this is to create an outline and use it as a framework for the final result.\nThis outline can then be split into a main heading, the title, and sub-headings for new points. Use lists (alphabetical lettering, bullet points, numbers, and Roman numerals) for information breakdown.\nIt is necessary to arrange your content properly to aid your reader\u0026rsquo;s search for specific bits of information. It also helps them to follow step-by-step instructions without needing clarification.\nUse Consistent Formatting Figure 5. Make use of consistent formatting.\nUse consistent formatting while writing. Do not mismatch the arrangement of written content while writing. For example, using images of different sizes and dimensions in the same piece could be less visually appealing and tends to put the reader off balance.\nUsing a variety of listings is not recommended as well. If you start the article with alphabetical lettering, stick to it. If you prefer numbers, stick to that also. Mixing them up makes your work look unarranged, giving off this unco-ordinated feeling.\nUse a particular font, and only use elements of typographical emphasis like capitalization, bold, italics, backtick, code blocks, and strikethrough where necessary, as these are used to draw attention to a particular word or phrase.\nWhere writing style guides are given, adhere to all its instructions and the minute details included. Maintaining consistent formatting while curating written content is important as it gives off a professional outlook.\nUse Plain Language Figure 6. Make use of plain language.\nTechnical writing means something other than that the content would be filled with technical jargon and hard-to-read sentences. Write in plain text and avoid using technical terms unless necessary.\nWhere technical terms are needed, explain them or relate them to familiar words. Use examples to break down complex concepts so readers can fully grasp them.\nDo not use vague, unfamiliar words. Do not use ambiguous text. Do not use trendy words or terms associated with only a particular region.\nDo not use offensive language, indigenous language, or broken language. Use editing tools to brush up on your grammar and composition skills if they need to be improved.\nInteractive Elements Figure 7. Make use of interactive elements.\nThese can include GIFs, memes (only when allowed), short videos, and simulations embedded in the content for further elaboration.\nThese will help readers assimilate faster and visualize without being taught physically.\nAdding frequently asked questions (FAQs), hyperlinks, and information from other official sources can also help readers get an unbiased view of a product and its competitors.\nThis can aid a product’s market standing, as users can compare and contrast products with similar features.\nNote that these elements should only be used in the content context. Anything other than that would be considered a distraction and look out of place.\nUser Feedback and Content Update Figure 8. Make use of user feedback and content update.\nLeave room for comments so the readers can talk about the content. This will help the writer know if their work had a positive impact.\nMost companies have a “Was this page helpful?” button, which users can click to indicate whether the content fulfilled its purpose.\nNote\nFor example, BMC documentation has a detailed explanation of how to create an avenue for readers to provide feedback and how to view feedback for written content. Read more about it here.\nThis will also aid in implementing needed corrections. Users can contribute to the content through open-source contributions.\nProducts will not remain the same for a long time. Their features can be updated to suit modern trends, and the product needs to be updated.\nIt is necessary to replace outdated information with current information throughout the product\u0026rsquo;s lifetime. This will prevent a steep learning curve for users and promote ease of use.\nNote\nFor example, medusajs, a headless CMS e-commerce platform, was formerly known as an open-source alternative to Shopify. At the start of 2023, this descriptive title was changed, and now they are known as an open-source platform, providing digital blocks for digital commerce.\nAny form of written content bearing the former description: an open-source alternative to Shopify is clearly outdated and counts as spreading misinformation to readers.\nWhy is Writing for User Experience (UX) Important in Technical Writing?
