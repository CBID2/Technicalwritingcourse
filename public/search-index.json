Different types of technical documentation The audience for technical documentation The purpose of technical documentation The technical writing process What is technical writing? Technical writing is a highly valued skill today, and the demand for technical writers will keep growing because of rapid advancements in science and technology. But, then, what is technical writing?\nTechnical writing is a specialized field that delivers clear and understandable instructions, directions, guidance, or information to a specific audience through documentation.\nTechnical writing mainly aims to break down hard concepts or information into simple concepts easily understood by the targeted audience.\nIn simple terms, technical writing provides factual and concise information to facilitate understanding and task completion.\nDifferent Types of Technical Documentation Technical documentation comprises detailed instructions, step-by-step guides, or information regarding a product or technology.\nTo create effective technical documentation, a technical writer must possess subject matter expertise, ensuring their audience can effortlessly comprehend the instructions or guides.\nFor instance, a technical writer lacking a strong background in programming cannot produce quality API documentation, as it demands a solid understanding of programming concepts like functions, arrays, objects, maps, and so on. There are numerous types of technical documentation, and their writing style varies. Below is a list of some types of technical documentation:\nTechnical reports: These documents provide detailed results of projects, research findings, investigations, and experiments in a specified field. They may include recommendations and conclusions.\nThe key elements of technical reports are the title, introduction, summary, experimental details, results and discussions, body, and conclusion.\nAn example of a technical report is the Complete Engineering and Economics of Solar Photovoltaic Hybrid Power System .\nInstallation Guides: These documents assist users or customers in installing software, products, or systems correctly. Installation guides give general instructions about products or software and step-by-step instructions for installation. Examples of installation guides are home appliances, computer software, etc.\nFor example, the Visual Studio Code provides detailed step-by-step instructions for installing VScode on your computer.\nUser manuals: These are also known as user guides or instruction manuals. It is a written document that provides information on product features, step-by-step guides, product functionality, and troubleshooting instructions in case of issues. An example of a user manual is WhatsApp User Manual.\nTechnical Specifications: These are manuals or documents that detail a product\u0026rsquo;s technical aspects. They also provide vital information about product development.\nFor instance, in software development, the technical specification manual provides essential information about an app, such as the problems it is solving, the features of the app, implementation plans, software\u0026rsquo;s architecture, programming languages, and libraries to be used for developing the app, the hardware requirement and testing procedures.\nAn example of a technical specification document is the Software Requirements Specification document.\nAPI Documentation: These documents guide users on integrating an application programming interface(API). It includes details on endpoints, authentication, request and response formats. An example is the Paystack API documentation.\nTechnical proposal: These are well-written documents that outline details of a proposed technical project, product, solution, and so on. The primary goal of a technical proposal is to show actionable plans to stakeholders or decision-makers, persuading them to accept and support the proposed project.\nFor instance, if a writer proposes a project to a company, the proposal should provide an overview, scope, target audience, and other essential project details.\nClick on this Technical Proposal Template to learn how to structure your technical proposal.\nWhite Papers: These documents provide comprehensive analysis, information, or recommendations on a specific topic, product, or technology. White papers are used across various fields to provide in-depth reports to aid understanding and decision-making.\nAn example of a white paper is the WhatsApp Security White Paper.\nRelease notes: These are documents that inform users, developers, or administrators about recent features of a software product, bug fixes, or any other update.\nFor example, a software company may introduce new features in their product, such as dark mood support, improved mobile responsiveness, streamlined navigation, and bug fixes, through release notes.\nThe Google Cloud Release Note is an example of a release note.\nOnline help: These digital documents provide instructions, guidance, or information to assist users in effectively using products.\nFor example, Google Chrome\u0026rsquo;s online help informs users about the browser, new features, and issues reporting.\nOnline help enhances the user experience by offering troubleshooting guides and product insights.\nAudience for technical documentation To become an effective technical writer, you must know your audience. Your audience is the people for whom you are writing.\nUnderstanding your audience is crucial because it determines what and how you communicate, allowing you to convey your message in a way that resonates with them. How can you know your audience?\nYou can understand your audience by asking yourself who they are. Consider questions like: Are my audience software developers, engineers, or technicians?\nAre they beginners or experts in their field? Why are they reading my documentation? What do they expect from it?\nAnswering these questions will help you determine your target audience and guide you in tailoring your writing style and content to meet their needs effectively.\nFor instance, you want to write an article titled: Introduction to technical writing.\nHere are some questions you need to ask yourself:\nIf you answer the questions above, this will help your readers understand this topic very well.\nNow, let’s use the questions above to know your target audience.\nWho am I writing for? Technical writers,\nWhat is their level of expertise? Beginners\nWhat do they expect from my article? They expect this article to give a comprehensive overview of technical writing, the audience for technical writing, types of technical documentation, tools and software for technical writing, and so on.\nPurpose for Technical Documentation There are numerous reasons for writing technical documentation. The purpose of technical documentation includes:\nGuidance: It provides comprehensive and easy-to-follow guidance, instructions, and directions on using a product, software, or service.\nReference: It serves as reference materials for product or service users, as it details a product\u0026rsquo;s different features.\nTraining materials: Technical documentation can be used to train new users, employees, or technicians.\nUpdates: It is used by companies to provide information about upgrades in their product or service.\nTroubleshooting: Technical documentation provides troubleshooting guides that can help users when they encounter a problem while using a product.\nTechnical writing process There are five technical writing steps.\nPlan: A popular saying goes, “If you fail to plan, you plan to fail”. This principle applies to technical writing as well.\nBefore you begin writing, planning and preparing for your topic is essential. Planning can be as straightforward as creating bullet points outlining the project you want to cover.\nThis mental exercise will help you address important questions about your audience.\nAt the planning stage, you need to determine your document\u0026rsquo;s purpose and scope, writing style, and length. A well-thought-out plan saves time and ensures a successful outcome.\nStructure: Structure serves as the backbone of your documentation, providing the necessary organization for the hierarchy of your document.\nYou lay a framework for how your document will unfold at this stage. For instance, creating a table of contents enhances the organization of your content and mentally prepares you for the writing journey.\nIt is also important to note that the structure of your document is not a rigid constraint; it evolves as you write, allowing for adaptability as you write.\nResearch: This stage is the foundational step in the documentation process. It involves getting all the information you need for your writing.\nThis includes reading relevant documents, watching videos, and interviewing experts in the field.\nFor instance, if you want to write about Google Chrome, you will need to read Google Chrome documentation and other relevant documents to know about its features and how they work. Watching tutorial videos, if needed, will help you gain more insights.\nFurthermore, gaining hands-on experience through practice deepens your knowledge and contributes to the quality of your documentation.\nTaking this approach will enable you to give your audience detailed and up-to-date information about the Google Chrome browser.\nWrite: In this stage, you will put all the information you have gathered into a logical and cohesive document. You must also write simply, clearly, and concisely, always keeping your audience in mind.\nAdapt your language to resonate with the specific needs of your readers. For instance, if you are writing for beginners, focus on clarity and provide explanations to ensure solid understanding.\nFor experts, delve into technical details assuming a deeper knowledge base.\nRemember that the document’s structure established in the earlier stage is your guide.\nEnsure seamless navigation through the content by adhering to this structure.\nFor clarity, incorporate images, code snippets, tables, screenshots, and diagrams in your document as it helps your readers comprehend the message you are passing faster.\nAs you craft your document, envision your audience engaging with the material and tailor your writing to meet their expectations.\nReview: This stage is the polishing stage. In this stage, your goal is to ensure the overall quality of your document. Start with reviewing your document.\nAs you review, pay close attention to maintaining a consistent writing style, correcting grammatical errors, and addressing misspelled words.\nNext, consider seeking the input of experts or colleagues in the field to review your document formally.\nThe goal of this stage is not just error correction but the refinement of your document to meet the highest standard of clarity and professionalism.\nPublish: This stage is the final step in releasing your document to reach your intended audience.\nPlatforms like Medium, Hashnode, Devrel, and other social media platforms can serve as avenues for sharing your work with the world.\nConsider the nature of your content and your target audience when deciding the suitable platform for publication.\n","date":"2023-08-07","id":13,"permalink":"/docs/technicalwritingcourse/intro-to-technical-writing/","summary":"Table of Contents What is technical writing?

Identify the Goal: Identify the primary goal of your document. Are you informing, instructing, or persuading your audience? Your goal will determine the structure and tone of your document.\n2. Define The Outcome: After reading your document, what should your user be able to do? Would you want them to be able to implement a specific Technology? Or would you want them to understand a complex concept? Or do you want them to be able to make an informed decision based on the information gained from your document?\n3. Content Scope: With your goal and outcome clearly defined, you can draft out the scope of your document\u0026rsquo;s content based on the technical background of your audience. What information should your audience have already, and what information do you want them to gain from your document?\nFormula for a good documentation\nAccording to Google’s Technical Writing course:\nA Good documentation = knowledge and skills your audience needs to do a task − your audience's current knowledge and skills\nAligning your information gathering with your document\u0026rsquo;s purpose ensures your technical document\u0026rsquo;s relevance and effectiveness.\nIdentify your sources of information The scope of your documentation will determine the sources you can gather information.\nThere are various information sources, each having its unique strengths and limitations. Here are some key sources of information:\n1. Subject Matter Experts (SMEs): A subject-matter expert is a person with deep knowledge, experience, and prowess in a particular field called \u0026ldquo;the subject\u0026rdquo;. They are a valuable and reliable source for:\nAccurate and insightful information, Best practices, and Everyday solutions to real-world problems, etc. Within that subject/field. You can get information from SMEs through:\nInterviews, Meetings, and Consultations. Apart from being a source of valuable information, SMEs can also help validate the accuracy and relevance of your content.\nHere are some helpful tips when engaging with an SME:\nAsk open-ended questions. This way, you are giving the expert room to provide detailed explanations. Follow up the discussion with a summary of your thoughts to be sure you didn\u0026rsquo;t miss anything and confirm you got everything right. Build a collaboration with the SMEs to help with future support and review. 2. Technical Documentation: Technical documentation is a document that provides instructions, explanations, and reference materials for a specific technical product, system, or process. It helps you understand how to use, debug, and learn more about the technical subject matter.\nYou can refer to already existing technical documentation that is current and relevant to your subject matter, such as:\nUser guides, White papers, API documentation, Research Papers, Technical Specifications, Glossary of Terms, FAQs, etc. While gathering information from these sources, a good practice is to cross-reference across multiple documents to verify the consistency of information.\nYou can always use Technical documents as a starting point and then complement their information with other sources, such as SMEs, as discussed above.\n3. Industry Publications and Blogs: You can also get valuable information from credible industry publications and blogs to supplement your content.\nWhen extracting information from this source, here are a few things to note:\nEnsure that the authors of these publications are from reliable sources. Remember that most blogs and publications reflect the trends and state of the art at the time of publication. Use this to assess the relevance of the information to your document\u0026rsquo;s objective. Blogs mostly reflect people’s personal opinions and experiences; you can always verify and cross-reference these different views to have a balanced perspective in your writing. 4. Online Forums and Communities: Online forums and communities relating to your Subject matter are great places to get different opinions from fellow community members on real-life experiences, fixes to common challenges, and feedback.\nYou can also get to ask questions and gather insights from community members. Again, you should verify the credibility of the information before using it to supplement your document.\n5. Additional Sources of Information: Other sources of information include but are not limited to:\nSocial Media and Podcasts, Competitor Analysis, User Feedback and Reviews, Tutorial Videos, etc. Always verify the credibility of the information obtained from these sources and cross-reference them to get reliable and accurate content.\nTaking a deeper approach to gathering information from various sources can significantly increase the quality and credibility of your technical writing.\nDevelop a research plan You can maximize your information-gathering process by developing a research plan. Your research plan should generally have:\nThe Document\u0026rsquo;s objective, Information Sources, Timelines and Deadlines. Setting Clear Objectives 1. Be Specific: Clearly outline the goals and objectives of your technical document by answering the question: \u0026ldquo;What specific information(s) do you want to deliver to your audience?\u0026rdquo; This will serve as a roadmap in your information-gathering process.\nFor example, instead of a general goal like “Understanding Programming Principles”, you can aim for a more targeted objective like: “Understanding SOLID principle in Kotlin“. This way, you have mapped out what software principle and programming language you will show examples.\n2. Prioritize: Based on your audience analysis, you can prioritize what topics are most important, thus focusing your research efforts on areas that will have the greatest impact on your audience. In our previous example: “Understanding SOLID principle in Kotlin”, you don\u0026rsquo;t need to research what Kotlin programming language is and its history because your audience is expected to be already familiar with Kotlin programming language.\n3. Use the Question-Driven Approach: Create specific questions that your audience should be able to answer after reading your document. This will act as a guide and help your technical document to stay focused and relevant.\nTime Management 1. Set Deadlines: Break down your research process into different phases and allocate realistic deadlines for each phase.\n2. Balance Depth and Breadth: From your audience analysis, allocate time based on how important and complex a topic is.\n3. Schedule Reviews: Have review sessions to assess your progress against the roadmap and timelines you set and make adjustments when needed.\nGather Information After creating a research plan, the next step will be to gather information from the various sources you mentioned in your research plan.\nThere are various methods and techniques you can employ when gathering information, some of which are:\n1. Systematic Data Collection: i. Follow your Research Plan: Your research plan already includes the goal of your document, the specific topics you would cover, and the questions your document should answer. Follow these systematically, collecting information according to them. This will help you stay organized and on track, ensuring you cover all the necessary areas.\nii. Adapt: Information is always evolving, so be prepared to alter your research plan as new information emerges.\niii. Have a Documentation Strategy: There are various ways of documenting your findings. Choose one and stay consistent with it. This will make it easier and quicker to recover and reference information later.\n2. Note-Taking and Organization i. Effective Note-Taking Techniques: Implementing the Cornell method or mind mapping can make your note-taking process more efficient. You can even choose to combine them, whichever works best for you. This will help you in documenting and retrieving information effectively.\nii. Categorization and Tagging: Using categories, tags, or labels to organize your notes will make it easier to find information, identify knowledge gaps, and connect information.\n3. Cross-verification and Fact-Checking Cross-verification confirms the accuracy of information obtained from a particular source by comparing it with different sources.\nIt is best practice to cross-verify your information to ensure consistency and highlight inconsistent areas for further research and investigation. When in doubt, you can also contact SMEs for further clarification.\nThis can help resolve ambiguities and ensure the accuracy of your information.\n4. Active Learning When writing about software or a tool, use them yourself and try out different use cases or scenarios with them.\nThis will give you firsthand experience and a deeper understanding of the subject, which will help you to write valuable insights that supersede theoretical research.\nDoing this may expose you to questions and challenges your audience might face.\nEvaluate and synthesize the information you have gathered. Information Evaluation After gathering information for your technical document, you must read through the technical document and critically analyze its:\n1. Accuracy and Credibility: By ensuring the information is correct, reliable, current, and error and bias free. Also, evaluate that your information source is reliable, from an expert, or a reputable publication.\n2. Relevance: Confirm that the information answers the questions you stated your document should answer in your Research Plan. This ensures that your document satisfies its purpose and objectives and is suitable for your audience. You can remove irrelevant information from your writing to maintain the focus of the writing.\nSynthesize your Data: After evaluating, you must organize your technical writing in a logical and orderly manner that is easy to read through and understand. You can do this by:\n1. Connecting the Dots: Identify the key themes and concepts and extract the central and unifying ideas. Look beyond the individual bits of information but see how they relate. One way to do this is by linking theoretical concepts with their real-world application or comparing the new technology with a technology your audience is familiar with.\n2. Organize the information into a logical structure: Structure your document so that each piece builds to the next. Highlight important points and findings while ensuring an uninterrupted flow of information in your document. Identifying repeating concepts in your documents can help you structure complex information in an easy-to-understand way.\n3. Storytelling and Engagement Strategies: An example of a storytelling approach is relating abstract concepts in your document to physical, relatable things or systems. Including real-world examples or hypothetical scenarios to illustrate important points will also help to make your document more engaging.\nReview and revise your information. The final step in information gathering is to review and revise your document to ensure that it is:\nClear, Concise, and free of unnecessary details. Based on facts and not personal opinions. Consistent and complete, having all the information that satisfies the purpose and objective of the document. Here are some review techniques you can employ:\n1. Self-Review You should read through your technical document as a first-time user and assess technical terms\u0026rsquo; logical progression and accuracy. Look for complex terms and sentences that can be simplified too.\nAlso, try to answer the questions you listed when setting your document\u0026rsquo;s goals and objectives to ensure your writing is relevant.\n2. Peer Review Share your technical document with peers that suit your audience description or SMEs for review and feedback. While doing this, you can make specific feedback requests by asking your reviewers how engaging or clear your technical document is to get more focused and useful feedback. You can make specific feedback requests by asking your reviewers how engaging or clear your technical document is to get more focused and useful feedback.\nYou can also ask them if your document answers the questions you listed when setting the goals and objectives to ensure that it is relevant. To get a thorough view of your document\u0026rsquo;s effectiveness, you can share it with reviewers having different perspectives or expertise levels.\nMake sure to address any gaps or inconsistencies identified during the review process, boosting the quality of your technical document.\n3. Incorporating Feedback and Revision: Analyze the feedback from your reviewers to determine which feedback will be implemented and revise your document based on this.\nYou can employ a revision strategy. An example may be addressing vital structural changes before moving to more detailed grammar changes.\nWhile analyzing and incorporating feedback, keep track of the changes you have made in case you need to revisit previous versions.\n4. Consistency Check and Final Proofreading Pay attention to the voice and style of your writing and ensure that you are adhering to a specific style guide like APA, MLA, or Google’s writing style guide.\nEnsure that the format for the headings, lists, etc in your document is consistent throughout the document.\nWhen proofreading, be on the lookout for grammatical errors and typos. You can use Grammar checkers, but be careful not to rely entirely on them.\n5. Practical Testing and Validation If your technical document includes hands-on instructions or coding, follow through with them yourself to ensure they work as expected.\nYou can also have your peer reviewers test the hands-on instructions or coding to be sure it\u0026rsquo;s simple and easy to follow.\nBe ready to revise the document, as this may reveal issues you might not have anticipated.\n","date":"2023-12-30","id":17,"permalink":"/docs/technicalwritingcourse/information-gathering/","summary":"Learn how to find the knowledge you need for your documentation.","tags":[],"title":"Information gathering"},{"content":"What is User Experience (UX)? Figure 1. The concept of writing for User Experience (UX).\nUser experience, otherwise known as UX, is used to describe the emotional sentiment of an individual when they use a product. This product can be of any form - physical or digital.\nUX is concerned with how the individual (the user in this context) can use the product according to its functionalities to fulfill their tasks, how well they understand its unique capabilities, and whether they have an overall pleasant experience.\nIt is also the sum of techniques employed by design and developer teams to make a product easy to use by the target audience.\nThere are common misconceptions attached to writing for user experience. This module will discuss them and attempt to clarify doubts with detailed explanations.\nThe first is this:: user experience (UX) and user interface (UI) are the same.\nUser experience (UX) is often and wrongly interchanged with the user interface (UI). Although both concepts complement each other, they have different components and, therefore, can not be used in place of one another. The user interface (UI) is the part of the product where the user can see, touch, and interact.\nThe second is this: writing for user experience and UX writing are the same.\nThis is untrue; here’s why. Writing for user experience is aimed at creating content that improves the usability of products for users, while UX writing is the written aspect of user interface design.\nFigure 2. Understanding user satisfaction in technical writing.\nIt involves crafting words, phrases, and sentences to fit a user interface. It is meant to make clear, readable, concise, and user-friendly text.\nThese concepts, user interface (UI), user experience (UX), and writing for user experience have one goal in common: user satisfaction. Now that you understand the meaning of user experience let us learn why it is important for technical writing.\nWhy is UX important for technical writing? Technical writing is creating specialized content to convey information about a product to its prospective and continuous users. Technical writing can be found in virtually every field, from medicine, telecommunication, sports, and media to software development.\nTechnical writers in this field are adequately trained to curate content with the key terms of each field.\nNote\nThe role of a technical writer can be likened to the function of a bridge. This person is the path that lies between the user and the product.\nIf the content created by the technical writer concerning a product does not explain all of its features, the user might not use the product properly. It also takes away the anticipated consumer satisfaction and reduces their productivity.\nJudging from the sensitive position of a technical writer, it is important to prepare written content so that users can understand and adequately describe the product’s features. This is where writing for user experience comes in. Writing for user experience is applying UX principles when curating written content. For instance, most software development tools and frameworks have steep learning curves and can be tasking, even for users with knowledge of similar products.\nThe technical writer\u0026rsquo;s role is to ensure they apply all the UX principles necessary while creating clear and concise documentation for users.\nWhat are these UX Principles? As with UX design, UX principles are a set of instructions that designers use to create products for users with the aim of ease of use and positive experiences.\nThere are a lot of UX principles, and this module will discuss them in the context of technical writing.\nThese are some UX principles.\nAccessibility This is a means of designing products users can access despite their disabilities. Technical writing is curating written content that can be easily read and understood despite disabilities.\nIt is not advisable to assume all product users are free from neurological and physical impairments.\nAccessibility can be achieved by splitting large paragraphs and adding diagrams and charts. Alternative texts should be included in images for description.\nConsistency As with popular brands, they can be associated with a particular slogan or color. A particular thing comes to mind whenever you hear or think of that brand. This is possible because the brand has created associated traits for themselves.\nFor example, Docker has the image of a whale carrying a stack of containers on its way to customers, closely related to their services.\nConsistency is maintaining the language, feel, and look of written content for a product across different marketing channels, on the website, blog, and official documentation.\nIt can be achieved by maintaining using a style guide. An ideal publication or company has a unique style guide that tells its technical writers how to construct their official documentation and other related documents.\nThis covers all aspects of written content, from grammar and composition, use of pronouns, addition of backlinks, SEO optimization, and others. A style guide prevents a disruption in the flow of content transmission, especially with the change of writers.\nUsability As it sounds, the usability of a product is ranked on how easy users find it to use. Technical writing refers to written content that can be understood and implemented by all product users, old and new.\nUsability can be achieved by testing already written content on brand-new users and noting their reactions and the rate of their learning curves. It can also be improved by conducting anonymous surveys, correcting loopholes, and permitting open-source contributions for users.\nHierarchy Hierarchy is the methodical arrangement of written content to suit an acceptable narrative. We know that when we pick up a book, the first word or phrase we expect to see is the title, followed by the author\u0026rsquo;s name.\nAfter that, the table of contents follows, then the main content/body of the content. Technical writing is a vast space as it covers proposals, white papers, tutorials, SDKs, and API documentation, all of which have different approaches.\nThe technical writer can achieve hierarchy with written content by writing it according to its requirements or outline.\nFor example, if you were to write a tutorial, you would write a title, add a cover image and prerequisites needed by the reader, and then the main body of the tutorial, assisted by visual aids to ensure they are on the right track.\nThe writer would add headings and sub-headings as needed (from h1-h5), bullet points, numerical or alphabetical lists for key points, and adequate paragraph spacing to make the content easy to read.\nContext This is an important principle that cuts across different sectors aside from technical writing. By creating documentation within context, users have access to specific information related to the concepts of a particular product.\nLet us consider this example: if a product caters to users with macOS and iOS devices and gadgets, writing troubleshooting guides and user guides that include Android and Linux-based devices may not be useful to the users.\nFindability This is the ease at which a specific piece of information can be found in written content so that users can easily find what they want using a search bar or keywords.\nFindability can be achieved by implementing hierarchy and information architecture to aid ease of use. Headings segment the content and make in-content searches easy to carry out.\nHow to Write User-Friendly Technical Documentation There are several ways to create user-friendly documentation. These steps are as follows:\nKnow Your Audience Figure 3. Know your audience before creating content.\nBefore creating content for users, it is important to research the background of the users. For example, tutorials for new users would differ from those curated for existing product users.\nTutorials for new users can be tagged “beginner guides”, such as “a beginner’s guide to creating Kubernetes clusters”, “everything you need to know about using headless CMS platforms”,“how to migrate from x to y as a newbie”, and similar titles.\nAs they are named, they should provide detailed information, carefully explain concepts, and name all the prerequisites for the user to follow the tutorial properly.\nExisting users with some experience with the product in question would not need to be coddled so much. Explaining concepts they are familiar with would only bore them, but adding prerequisites, visual aids, and aids for troubleshooting issues is still necessary.\nIt is necessary to apply tact when choosing how to write for your audience, as a single misstep can cause user dissatisfaction. This eludes the aim of catering towards a positive user experience.\nImplement Information Architecture Figure 4. Implement information architecture while creating technical written content.\nInformation architecture is the process of organizing written content for ease of use and navigation. It can be implemented by making optimal use of white space.\nThis prevents the content from looking clumped and bulky. Readers often lose interest in written content when it looks bulky, as it plants a notion they would not finish.\nAlso, with the advent of information being delivered at very short intervals, lengthy sentences and paragraphs tend to receive less positive treatment. Arrange your content accordingly in a manner that permits easy navigation. An easy way to do this is to create an outline and use it as a framework for the final result.\nThis outline can then be split into a main heading, the title, and sub-headings for new points. Use lists (alphabetical lettering, bullet points, numbers, and Roman numerals) for information breakdown.\nIt is necessary to arrange your content properly to aid your reader\u0026rsquo;s search for specific bits of information. It also helps them to follow step-by-step instructions without needing clarification.\nUse Consistent Formatting Figure 5. Make use of consistent formatting.\nUse consistent formatting while writing. Do not mismatch the arrangement of written content while writing. For example, using images of different sizes and dimensions in the same piece could be less visually appealing and tends to put the reader off balance.\nUsing a variety of listings is not recommended as well. If you start the article with alphabetical lettering, stick to it. If you prefer numbers, stick to that also. Mixing them up makes your work look unarranged, giving off this unco-ordinated feeling.\nUse a particular font, and only use elements of typographical emphasis like capitalization, bold, italics, backtick, code blocks, and strikethrough where necessary, as these are used to draw attention to a particular word or phrase.\nWhere writing style guides are given, adhere to all its instructions and the minute details included. Maintaining consistent formatting while curating written content is important as it gives off a professional outlook.\nUse Plain Language Figure 6. Make use of plain language.\nTechnical writing means something other than that the content would be filled with technical jargon and hard-to-read sentences. Write in plain text and avoid using technical terms unless necessary.\nWhere technical terms are needed, explain them or relate them to familiar words. Use examples to break down complex concepts so readers can fully grasp them.\nDo not use vague, unfamiliar words. Do not use ambiguous text. Do not use trendy words or terms associated with only a particular region.\nDo not use offensive language, indigenous language, or broken language. Use editing tools to brush up on your grammar and composition skills if they need to be improved.\nInteractive Elements Figure 7. Make use of interactive elements.\nThese can include GIFs, memes (only when allowed), short videos, and simulations embedded in the content for further elaboration.\nThese will help readers assimilate faster and visualize without being taught physically.\nAdding frequently asked questions (FAQs), hyperlinks, and information from other official sources can also help readers get an unbiased view of a product and its competitors.\nThis can aid a product’s market standing, as users can compare and contrast products with similar features.\nNote that these elements should only be used in the content context. Anything other than that would be considered a distraction and look out of place.\nUser Feedback and Content Update Figure 8. Make use of user feedback and content update.\nLeave room for comments so the readers can talk about the content. This will help the writer know if their work had a positive impact.\nMost companies have a “Was this page helpful?” button, which users can click to indicate whether the content fulfilled its purpose.\nNote\nFor example, BMC documentation has a detailed explanation of how to create an avenue for readers to provide feedback and how to view feedback for written content. Read more about it here.\nThis will also aid in implementing needed corrections. Users can contribute to the content through open-source contributions.\nProducts will not remain the same for a long time. Their features can be updated to suit modern trends, and the product needs to be updated.\nIt is necessary to replace outdated information with current information throughout the product\u0026rsquo;s lifetime. This will prevent a steep learning curve for users and promote ease of use.\nNote\nFor example, medusajs, a headless CMS e-commerce platform, was formerly known as an open-source alternative to Shopify. At the start of 2023, this descriptive title was changed, and now they are known as an open-source platform, providing digital blocks for digital commerce.\nAny form of written content bearing the former description: an open-source alternative to Shopify is clearly outdated and counts as spreading misinformation to readers.\nWhy is Writing for User Experience (UX) Important in Technical Writing? Writing for user experience (UX) is an essential skill for technical writers. Writing aims to ensure users enjoy a product’s capabilities and derive a positive experience while using it.\nThis module explained the meaning of user experience and highlighted popular misconceptions about it. It further discussed why user experience is important for technical writing and the UX principles writers can apply.\nWriting user-friendly documentation is no mean feat, but as with every skill, it can be learned. Applying the methods taught will be sure to give you positive results.\n","date":"2023-12-17","id":18,"permalink":"/docs/technicalwritingcourse/writing-for-user-experience-ux/","summary":"Understanding user experience (UX) prinicples and how to implement them in technical writing.","tags":[],"title":"Writing for User Experience (UX)"},{"content":"Module content What is a writing style guide? How to create a writing style guide Why is it important for technical writers to have a writing style guide? Popular style guides and how to pick one for your project What is a writing style guide? A writing style guide, also known as a manual of style, is a document containing standards (rules) for writing and formatting documents. Its purpose is to assist writers in maintaining consistency in their writing style and ensuring that the documentation is clear and easy to understand.\nWhether crafting a blog article or collaborating with a documentation team, a style guide is crucial in maintaining a consistent brand voice and tone. Without this consistency in your writing style, your readers may struggle to grasp your intended message.\nFor instance, observe how the Google Developers documentation style guide utilizes its guide to maintain consistency.\nIn the following example, you\u0026rsquo;ll see clear guidelines on formatting lists. They not only provide clear guidelines but also examples on representing various list types in their documentation and how to introduce them.\nGoogle Developers Documentation Style Guide Sample\nIntroductory sentences for lists\nIntroduce a list with the appropriate context. In most cases, precede a list with an introductory sentence.\nThe sentence can end with a colon or a period; usually a colon if it immediately precedes the list, usually a period if there\u0026rsquo;s more material (such as a note paragraph) between the introduction and the list.\nIf the list doesn\u0026rsquo;t need any additional context other than the heading that immediately precedes the list, it\u0026rsquo;s OK to not introduce a list with an introductory sentence.\nIntroduce a list with a complete sentence, not a partial one that\u0026rsquo;s completed by the list items. You can also use the following as a noun phrase (see following in the word list).\nRecommended Use the Submit button for any of the following purposes:\nTo submit the form. To indicate that you\u0026rsquo;re done. To allow the next person to enter their data.

This allows you to tailor the guide to effectively communicate your company\u0026rsquo;s values, establish a desired voice and tone, and ensure the use of appropriate grammar and punctuation.\nIn this section, you\u0026rsquo;ll delve into these essential aspects and more for creating a comprehensive style guide.\nThe following are important attributes that must be contained in your style guide:\nEstablishing the Company\u0026rsquo;s Brand\nThe initial step in crafting an effective guide involves aligning the writer\u0026rsquo;s mindset with the company\u0026rsquo;s identity, values, and objectives.\nThis step is crucial as it enables the writer to comprehend the company\u0026rsquo;s brand and how to effectively communicate it to the reader.\nAddressing a company\u0026rsquo;s brand entails emphasizing its values, mission, and vision. Placing your company\u0026rsquo;s brand identity at the forefront of your style guide is essential, serving as a constant reminder for the writer.\nAn excellent illustration of effective brand communication is demonstrated by Slack. They clearly outline their identity, values and all they represent.\nFigure 1. Slack\u0026rsquo;s brand identity\nWhile a solo writer may find this step less critical, it becomes crucial when collaborating with a team of writers. Ensuring everyone is aligned with the company\u0026rsquo;s brand fosters consistency in communication.\nUtilize an Existing Publishing Guide\nWhile you embark on creating your own guide, it\u0026rsquo;s worth remembering that guides have a rich history, and there\u0026rsquo;s no need to reinvent the wheel. Consider using an existing publishing guide as a starting point for crafting your own.\nChoose a guide that aligns with your specific requirements. For instance, if you\u0026rsquo;re working on technical documentation, opt for a APA Style guide. If you\u0026rsquo;re crafting an academic document, consider using the MLA handbook.\nVoice and Tone\nUnderstanding voice and tone is crucial, yet it can be misunderstood by many writers. Voice represents the personality of your writing, while tone sets the mood.\nVoice and Tone tip\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re composing a blog post about a new product, aim for a friendly voice and an excited tone.\nFor companies with diverse social media outlets for customer communication, maintaining a consistent voice and tone is essential. This consistency plays a key role in building trust with customers.\nWhen determining the tone and voice for your company, consider asking a few key questions:\nAre you aiming to be formal or informal? Do you prefer a friendly or professional tone? Is your style more serious or humorous? Answering these questions will guide you in making decisions about the tone and voice that best represent your company.\nAn exemplary case of a company effectively communicating its voice and tone is Mailchimp. They provide extensive details on how their company engages with customers.\nFigure 2. Mailchimps voice and tone\nGrammar and Punctuation\nHaving defined the voice and tone, it\u0026rsquo;s now time to delve into the finer details of your guide. Consistent rules regarding grammar and punctuation are essential; otherwise, your documentation may become confusing for your readers.\nWhen determining the grammar and punctuation rules for your company, consider asking a few questions:\nDo you want to use the Oxford comma? Are you inclined towards the serial comma? Is the em dash or en dash your preference? Given the multitude of standards in this area, refer to Shopify\u0026rsquo;s style guide for a comprehensive example. They provide clear explanations with numerous examples to illustrate their grammar and punctuation rules.\nFigure 3. Shopify\u0026rsquo;s grammar and punctuation\nIn your guide, be sure to provide examples for every point you make. This practice aids your writers in understanding the intended message and application of the guidelines.\nFormatting\nWhile many guides combine the formatting and grammar sections, I\u0026rsquo;ve chosen to separate them due to their distinct nature. Formatting pertains to how you present content to your readers. Consider questions like whether to use bold or italics, headings or subheadings, lists or tables, etc.\nWhen establishing formatting rules for your company, pose key questions to guide your decisions;\nDo you prefer using bold or italics for emphasis? What is your approach to using headings or subheadings? Are lists or tables the preferred format? Asking these questions will aid in defining the formatting style for your documentation.\nA notable example of effective documentation formatting can be found in the Google Developer Documentation Style Guide. This guide provides comprehensive rules for formatting, covering areas such as headings, titles, numbers, lists, tables, and more.\nFigure 4. Google Developer Documentation Style Guide formatting section\nTerminology and abbreviations\nTo create the terminology and abbreviations section, compile a comprehensive list of all terms and abbreviations specific to your company. This list guides writers in using the correct terms and abbreviations in documentation.\nWhen deciding on terminology and abbreviations, consider key questions:\nShould two-letter initialisms have periods? How do you introduce abbreviations? What significance do italics and abbreviations hold for your company? Answering these questions aids in making informed decisions for your style guide.\nA commendable example of incorporating terminology and abbreviations into documentation can be found in The 18F Content Guide. This guide provides insights into when to use abbreviations, how to introduce them, and more.\nFigure 5. 18F\u0026rsquo;s Content Guide terminology and abbreviations section\nImages and diagrams\nWhile many companies have a separate design style guide for visuals and media content, it\u0026rsquo;s crucial to include essential information on how writers source images.\nCertain questions need answers if writers are responsible for creating images or diagrams. For instance:\nWhat is the preferred image format? Are there specific preferred dimensions? Should all images include a brand logo? Addressing these questions will provide clarity for writers creating visual content.\nProviding guidance on producing images aligned with the company\u0026rsquo;s goals is essential for writers. DigitalOcean serves as an excellent example, effectively communicating necessary information about incorporating images into content.\nFigure 6. DigitalOcean\u0026rsquo;s image and assets style guide section\nNote\nStriking the right balance is crucial for a style guide—it shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be excessively long, diverting writers\u0026rsquo; focus and resulting in subpar documentation, nor should it be too short, leading to random filling of missing parts and conflicts in style. An optimal style guide typically spans three to five pages, offering sufficient, focused information for writers.\nUtilize a Template If you prefer not to start from scratch or are on a tight deadline to create a company style guide, consider using a template. Templates serve as boilerplate guides where you can input your company\u0026rsquo;s information, including vision, mission, and all the necessary sections discussed above.\nWhile a quick Google search yields several style guide templates, Writers.com offers a particularly neat and recommended template. Downloading this template provides a solid starting point for creating your style guide.\nAlways keep in mind that consistency is the key to a good style guide. Adhere consistently to the standards and rules you adopt.\nWhy is it important for technical writers to have a writing style guide? The primary aim of a style guide is to enhance communication between the writer and the reader. With a well-defined style guide, writers can uphold consistency throughout their documents, thereby reducing the cognitive load on readers.\nBelow are few reasons why adopting a style guide is beneficial:\nEstablishing a distinct brand representation: Take popular blogs like MDN or DigitalOcean, for instance. You can quickly identify an article as theirs simply by observing the writing style. This is made possible by their adherence to a style guide, ensuring a consistent brand voice and tone.\nMDN Writing Style Guide Sample\nHow to add images and media\nTo add an image to a document, add your image file to the document\u0026rsquo;s folder, and then reference the image from within the document\u0026rsquo;s index.md file using Markdown image syntax or the equivalent HTML element.\nTo learn more about MDN writing style guide, visit MDN Web Docs.\nThis is crucial as it contributes to building trust with your readers. When readers trust you, they are more inclined to return for more content. This is particularly significant for technical writers aiming to establish a brand or companies seeking to cultivate a community around their product.\nMinimize readers\u0026rsquo; cognitive load: A style guide enables you to sustain consistency in your writing style, simplifying the understanding of your documentation for readers. Without a style guide, readers would need to invest more time deciphering your documentation due to inconsistency of content.\nThe longer it takes for readers to comprehend your documentation, the higher the likelihood they\u0026rsquo;ll leave. This is detrimental for your blog or company, as it translates to potential loss of subscribers or customers.\nSimplified editing process: A style guide streamlines the editing of your documentation for your editors. With a clear set of guidelines, they know exactly what to look for during the editing process. Without a style guide, editors would spend more time figuring out what needs editing.\nThe longer editors spend searching for useful information to edit your documentation, the greater the chance of making mistakes. These errors can have significant repercussions on the credibility of your documentation.\nSingle Source of Truth (SSOT): It serves as a centralized point of reference containing all information related to your documentation. SSOT encompasses grammar and punctuation rules, formatting guidelines, terminologies, abbreviations, as well as visual elements like images and diagrams.\nThe lack of a style guide means that your writers will invest more time figuring out how to format their documents. This is due to the absence of a trustworthy source containing all the necessary information for editing their documentation.\nPopular style guides and how to pick one for your project While you can create your own style guide (which we\u0026rsquo;ll discuss later), there are advantages to relying on an existing guide.\nUsing an existing style guide saves time since you don\u0026rsquo;t have to create one from scratch; you can simply choose one that fits your needs and start using it immediately.\nStyle guides are categorized based on the type of content they address. Examples include style guides for technical documentation, academic writing, open source documentation, and more.\nHere are details about some of the most popular style guides, aiding you in selecting the one suitable for your project.\n1.

Don\u0026rsquo;t mix and match different style guides because the representation of information can confuse your readers.\n","date":"2023-12-17","id":19,"permalink":"/docs/technicalwritingcourse/writing-style-guide/","summary":"Understanding the importance of style guides and how to create one.","tags":[],"title":"Writing style guide"},{"content":"Visual elements like diagrams, images, and illustrations are effective tools for making your documentation engaging and easy to understand. They\u0026rsquo;re great for explaining complex concepts, processes, or workflows. Additionally, they break up large chunks of text and improve readability.\nUsing diagrams is an effective way to communicate complex ideas. They present information visually, making it easier to understand and remember compared to lengthy paragraphs.\nDiagrams also illustrate relationships between concepts, helping you grasp the bigger picture. Incorporating them into your work can save time, simplify communication, and enhance documentation clarity.\nWhy do you need diagrams in your documentation? Diagrams in your documentation can enhance communication. Consider using them for the following reasons:\nVisual clarity: People learn and understand information differently. Diagrams provide a visual representation, clarifying complex concepts and making information accessible.\nSimplify complexity: Technical documentation often involves intricate systems. A well-crafted diagram breaks down complexity, making it easier for readers to grasp.\nEnhance comprehension: A picture is worth a thousand words. Diagrams can replace lengthy text, showing relationships between components and improving comprehension.\nQuick reference: Diagrams serve as quick guides for troubleshooting or processes. Users can glance at them for guidance instead of reading through paragraphs.\nTime-saving: In the fast-paced world of technology, time matters. Diagrams help users quickly find information, reducing the time spent searching through extensive documentation.\nDid you know?\nDid you know that most installation manuals use images to guide users through the process instead of text? Utitlizing this method allows these manuals to be used by people who speak different languages.\nDiagrams are useful for conveying messages in various technical documentation forms, such as API documentation, how-to guides, tutorials, or a simple README file. However, creating diagrams may be challenging without design skills or proper tools.\nTools you can use to create diagrams Effective diagrams require the right tools. Numerous tools are available, but not all are equal. Here are some options:\nFigma: Known for interface design, Figma is also great for diagrams. Its user-friendly interface and collaborative features make it ideal for technical documentation.\nDraw.io: Specifically designed for graphs and diagrams, this tool supports collaboration and is free to use.\nLucidchart: Popular in cloud engineering, Lucidchart is free and excellent for creating architecture diagrams of complex systems.\nExcalidraw: This tool creates sketch-like diagrams with a freehand feel, offering a natural and authentic look.\nMicrosoft Visio: If you use Microsoft Office, Visio is a powerful tool for professional-looking diagrams.\nAll these tools can export diagrams in various formats (SVG, PNG, JPG), making it easy to insert them into your documentation.\nHow to create effective diagrams Creating understandable diagrams is crucial. If your diagram is too complex, readers may struggle to follow your message. Here are tips for effective diagram creation:\n1. Keep It Simple, Yet Informative: Simplify your diagram for clarity. Each element should directly contribute to understanding the concept. For instance, in cloud engineering, architectural diagrams should present a high-level view without overwhelming details.\nFigure 1. Architectural diagram displaying clear information\n2. Embrace Consistency: Consistency is key. Use uniform shapes, colors, and formatting throughout. In web development, consistent symbols in user flow diagrams make it easier for developers and designers to interpret user journeys across different parts of a website.\nFigure 2. User flow diagram displaying image design consistency\n3. Thoughtful Use of Labels and Annotations: Guide the reader with clear labels and annotations. In data science, well-placed annotations in process flow diagrams highlight critical steps, aiding data scientists in understanding and optimizing workflows.\nFigure 3. Data flow diagram displaying proper use of labels\n4. Align with Audience Expectations: Tailor your diagrams to your audience. In network security, align a network topology diagram with security professionals\u0026rsquo; expectations. Highlight security layers, emphasize attack vectors, and use familiar conventions for effective communication.\n5. Utilize Visual Hierarchy: Guide the reader\u0026rsquo;s eye with visual hierarchy. In plain diagrams explaining conceptual ideas, use size, color, or placement to emphasize key elements. This enhances understanding, whether illustrating a decision-making process or showcasing relationships between concepts.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s not just about creating a diagram but creating one that works. Keep it simple, consistent, and aligned with your audience\u0026rsquo;s needs. Your diagrams, when simple and aligned, become powerful tools for communication in any technical domain. Embrace the visual language, and let your diagrams tell a compelling story!\nDo\u0026rsquo;s and Don\u0026rsquo;ts for effective technical diagrams As with any concept, usage rules apply. Consider the following when creating diagrams for technical documentation:\nDo\u0026rsquo;s for Using Images in Technical Documentation:\nUtilize alt text: Include descriptive alt text for images. This boosts SEO and ensures accessibility for screen reader users, enhancing inclusivity.\nThe following is an example of alt text in markdown:\n![alt text](/path/to/image.png) Figure descriptions: Accompany images with clear figure descriptions. This helps readers, especially in scenarios like network security diagrams.\nThe following is an example of a figure description in markdown:\nFigure [NUMBER]. [DESCRIPTION] Give credit: Provide proper attribution when using images created by others. This maintains ethical standards in content creation, crucial in web development.\nThe following is an example of image attribution in markdown:\n![alt text](/path/to/image.png) Figure [NUMBER]. [DESCRIPTION] Image source: [SOURCE] Or you can give credit in the figure description:\nFigure [NUMBER]. [Image source] from [image author] High resolution: Maintain high-quality images for clear and legible details, benefiting both technical writers and developers.\nUnified formats: Stick to consistent image formats for a polished look. Whether you\u0026rsquo;re a technical writer or developer, using a unified format enhances professionalism and readability.\nDon\u0026rsquo;ts for Using Images in Technical Documentation:\nAvoid overcomplicating images: Steer clear of overwhelming your audience with overly complex images. Whether you\u0026rsquo;re a developer illustrating code architecture or a technical writer creating process flow diagrams, prioritize simplicity. Avoid unnecessary details that might confuse rather than clarify.\nAvoid unclear figure descriptions: Ensure figure descriptions are clear and concise. Technical writers and editors should provide enough information for readers to understand the image\u0026rsquo;s relevance. Ambiguous descriptions can lead to misinterpretation.\nAvoid including personal information: Be cautious not to include personal information in diagrams or screenshots, especially when showcasing your codebase. Prevent exposing sensitive information to the public.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t Neglect Consistency in Style: Maintain a consistent style throughout your technical diagrams. Whether you\u0026rsquo;re a developer illustrating system interactions or a technical writer creating documentation, inconsistency in style can lead to confusion. Stick to a unified design language to ensure a cohesive and professional appearance across all your visual elements.\n","date":"2023-11-17","id":20,"permalink":"/docs/technicalwritingcourse/use-of-diagrams/","summary":"This article explains the use of diagrams in technical documentation.

It gives technical document accuracy, consistency, clarity, and better user comprehension. With editing, you check for organization, navigation, paragraph structure, style, tone, and overall content.\nEveryone can coin a write-up, but what makes a valuable document is its conciseness and correctness, edited to fit all required criteria (Such as style, tone, audience needs, and so on).\nRobert Cormier says - “The beautiful part of writing is that you don\u0026rsquo;t have to get it right the first time, unlike, say, a brain surgeon. You can always do it better; find the exact word, the apt phrase, the leaping simile.\u0026quot; Editing is the other layer of work that makes your technical documentation better.\nIn this module, you will learn how to edit for clarity, conciseness, and accuracy (correctness), the importance of technical editing, and the various aspects of editing in detail.\nImportance of Editing Editing is an essential step in the documentation process for several reasons: It ensures clarity, conciseness, and accuracy in a technical document, but we will explore this aspect in the coming sections of this module.\nOther vital importance of editing in technical documentation include;\nError Prevention and Correction: Technical editing ensures meticulous proofreading to identify and correct errors in grammar, spelling, punctuation, and technical details. Documentation must be error-free to maintain credibility.\nConsistency in Style and Terminology: Editing ensures consistent terminology, style, and formatting use throughout the document. Consistent language helps readers understand and interpret technical information, reducing the risk of confusion or misinterpretation.\nAlignment with Standards and Guidelines: Organizations have specific standards and guidelines for technical documentation, and editing ensures the document aligns with these standards. It aids compliance and adherence to the organizations\u0026rsquo; regulations.\nEnhancement of Readability and Accessibility: Technical editing involves breaking down complex ideas into digestible chunks, using appropriate headings and subheadings, and incorporating visual elements. Enhanced readability makes technical content more user-friendly for a diverse audience.\nLogical Organization of Information: Technical editing involves assessing the document\u0026rsquo;s structure and organization. Editing ensures a logical arrangement of information, following a clear and coherent flow. A well-organized document facilitates efficient information retrieval and supports the reader\u0026rsquo;s understanding of complex concepts.\nThe coming section talks about the various aspects of editing.\nDifferent types of editing Ernest Hemingway says - \u0026ldquo;The first draft of anything is shit.\u0026rdquo; These emphasize the importance of the editing process in refining initial drafts; there are different kinds of editing in some technical documentation.\nYou may use all the various methods for one documentation; in others, you may pair one of each to meet your editing goals.\nThis section explores Proofreading, Copy editing, and substantive editing.\nProofreading Proofreading focuses on finding and correcting errors within writing, grammar, tense, language, typography, spelling, and punctuation. It is carefully examining your work for any remaining mistakes.\nWith proofreading, it is important to slowly and carefully read through your work.\nAn in-depth look at how proofreading works in the context of technical documentation:\nIdentifying and Correcting Typos: One primary objective of proofreading is to catch and correct typographical errors or \u0026ldquo;typos\u0026rdquo; in the document. It includes instances where you omit or duplicate letters or words. Proofreading goes through the document to spot and rectify such mistakes.\nChecking for Spelling Errors: Spelling errors are common in technical documentation and undermine the credibility of the content. Proofreading carefully reviews the document to identify and rectify any misspelled words. It includes common words and industry-specific terminology.\nCorrecting Grammatical Mistakes: Proofreading involves the correction of grammatical errors. It includes issues such as, subject-verb agreement, verb tense consistency, pronoun-antecedent agreement, and sentence structure. Proper grammar is essential for clear and effective communication.\nAddressing Punctuation Issues: Correct punctuation gives clarity to technical documentation. Proofreading ensures punctuation marks such as commas, semicolons, colons, and periods work correctly. They also check for consistent formatting with quotation marks, parentheses, and other special characters.\nCross-Referencing and Hyperlinks: You have cross-references and hyperlinks to related sections or external resources. Proofreading reviews these elements to ensure they are accurate and functional. Broken links or incorrect references disrupt the reader experience and undermine the document\u0026rsquo;s reliability.\nFormatting and Layout: Proofreading pays attention to the document\u0026rsquo;s formatting and layout, including issues like line spacing, margins, and alignment. They ensure the document is visually appealing and adheres to any formatting guidelines.\nConsistency in Abbreviations and Acronyms: Proofreading verifies that abbreviations are consistently applied throughout the document and are defined or explained upon first use.\nExample of proofreading;\nOriginal: The studnet\u0026#39;s preformance on the experiment was exceelent, demnstrating a thorough understandng of the scientific methode. Proofread Version: The student\u0026#39;s performance in the experiment was excellent, demonstrating a thorough understanding of the scientific method. Notice how (student\u0026rsquo;s), (excellent), and (demostrating) were wrongly spelt in the orginal.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s important to note that proofreading needs a keen eye for detail, a strong command of language, and a thorough understanding of the subject matter. While proofreading can enhance the overall quality of technical documentation by eliminating surface-level errors, it is just the first step in the editing process.\nSubsequent editing stages, such as copy and substantive editing, focus on more comprehensive aspects of the document, such as content clarity, style, and overall structure.\nCopy Editing Copy editing involves shaping the technical documentation. It ensures factual and stylistic consistency across the technical document, improves readability, improves sentence flow, and corrects tone inconsistencies. Copy editing is a factor that makes sure a piece of writing is accurate, clear, and correct.\nCopy editing ensures the document adheres to a specific style guide, maintains a consistent voice, and presents technical information in a manner that is accessible and engaging for the target audience.\nHow copy editing works in technical documentation:\nStyle and Consistency: Copy editing enforces a consistent style throughout the document. It includes ensuring elements such as headings, subheadings, font styles, and formatting adhere to a predefined style guide (industry standard or organizational guideline).\nTone and Voice: Copy editing focuses on maintaining a consistent tone and voice throughout the document. It ensures the documentation tone aligns with the audience expectations. The tone is more formal and informative for technical documentation but may need to be adjusted to fit the specific audience.\nEliminating Redundancy: Redundant information clutter technical documentation. Esther Freud says - “Editing is everything. Cut until you can cut no more.\u0026quot; Copy editing helps you trim excesses and refine your work to its essential components. You identify and eliminate unnecessary repetition or redundant content to ensure the document is concise.\nConciseness and Efficiency: Copy editing makes documentation more concise by removing wordiness and unnecessary tenses. Concise writing is essential for maintaining readers interest and conveying information efficiently.\nSentence and Paragraph Structure: Copy editing evaluates sentences and paragraph structure to ensure information logically flows. It may reorganize paragraphs or suggest changes in the sentence structure to enhance the overall coherence of the document.\nVisual Elements: Copy editing reviews visual elements such as tables, figures, diagrams, and captions to ensure correct labeling, format, and reference within the text. It also checks if visual elements are consistent with the overall style of the document.\nReferences and Citations: If the document includes references, citations, or footnotes, copy editing verifies their accuracy and consistency with the chosen citation style, such as APA, MLA, or a specific industry standard.\nExample of copy editing;\nOriginal: The company\u0026#39;s marketing strategy is good. They aim to reach a wide audience and their products are superior than others in the market. Copy Edited Version: The company\u0026#39;s marketing strategy is effective. They aim to reach a broad audience, and their products are superior to others in the market. Notice how copy editing fixed the sentence structure and the tone/voice.\nCopy editing ensures the document conveys accurate technical information clearly, concisely, and engagingly, enhancing its usability and effectiveness.\nSubstantive Editing Substantive editing is a more in-depth and comprehensive stage of the editing process. It involves shaping the consistency, cohesiveness, and conciseness of technical documentation.\nWith consistency, substantive editing ensures that information presented in diverse parts of the document does not contradict each other. Take the example of having “producer” and “manufacturer” in the same document.\nWith cohesiveness, it ensures information flows logically. You can use a where you may have:\nlogical arrangement alphabetical arrangement Start Accelerate Accelerate Brake Brake Start Stop Stop Substantive editing checks the intended use, organization, flow, and content strength. You can also check if too much or too little information is present and if similar information is presented consistently across documentation. But it is always better to use less information. Thomas Jefferson says - “The most valuable of all talents is that of never using two words when one will do.\u0026quot;\nHow substantive editing works in technical documentation:\nContent Evaluation: It evaluates the overall documentation content to ensure it aligns with the documentation purpose and target audience. It assesses whether the content is relevant, accurate, and comprehensive.\nStructural Reorganization: It involves reorganizing the document\u0026rsquo;s structure for optimal clarity. You suggest changes to the order of sections, headings, and subheadings to ensure a logical flow of information. This restructuring makes complex technical concepts more accessible to readers.\nContent Expansion or Reduction: Depending on the documentation purpose, substantive editing may recommend adding more detailed explanations or examples for better clarity. Conversely, it might require condensing overly thorough content to maintain conciseness while preserving essential information.\nTone and Voice Adjustment: It fine-tunes the documentation tone and voice. It ensures the content is better pitched (for end-users, technical experts, or other stakeholders). The adjustment helps maintain the readers engagement.\nEnhancing Clarity: It makes the technical content clear, rephrases sentences, simplifies complex language, and provides concise simplification for technical terms and concepts. The goal is to ensure readers with limited technical knowledge grasp the information.\nFact-Checking and Accuracy: It pays meticulous attention to the accuracy of the information presented. Substantive editing verifies data, statistics, references, and technical details to ensure they are up-to-date and accurate. The fact-checking is essential for maintaining the documentation’s credibility.\nConsistency in Terminology: It confirms that terminology and technical jargon work consistently throughout the documentation. It may create a glossary to define all technical terms and ensure the definition or explanation of the terms upon first use.\nCross-Referencing and Citations: It checks the accuracy and consistency of cross-references, citations, and footnotes. Substantive editing ensures correct formatting of all references according to the chosen citation style, such as APA, MLA, or a specific industry standard.\nVisual Elements: Substantive editing reviews and suggests improvements to visual elements, such as tables, figures, diagrams, and captions. It confirms if these elements enhance the content\u0026rsquo;s clarity and integrate effectively into the text.\nUsability and Accessibility: It considers the usability and accessibility of the document. It includes assessing its navigational aids, such as headings, bulleted lists, and links, to ensure readers easily find information. Ensuring better accessibility of the document to individuals with disabilities in compliance with relevant accessibility standards.\nExample of substantive editing;\nOriginal: In this report, we discuss various aspects of climate change. The first section is about causes, the second is about effects, and the third is about solutions. Substantive Edited Version: This report comprehensively explores climate change, covering its causes, effects, and potential solutions in three distinct sections. Notice how substantive editing fixed the overall structure, organization, and content.\nSubstantive editing is a critical step in producing high-quality technical documentation. It ensures the documentation communicates accurate technical information but does so in a way that is clear, well-structured, and tailored to the needs of the intended audience, ultimately enhancing its value and impact.\nThe coming section explores editing technical documentation for clarity, conciseness, and accuracy (correctness).\nEditing Technical Documentation for Clarity, Conciseness, and Correctness (Accuracy) Editing for clarity, conciseness, and correctness is a standard for producing credible and quality technical documentation. The section details how to edit technical documentation with the 3Cs.\nClarity Clarity refers to the quality of being clear, transparent, and easily understood. It involves expressing ideas, information, or instructions in a way that is easy for the audience to comprehend. A clear message is free from ambiguity, confusion, or unnecessary complexity.Editing for clarity ensures easy understanding for its target audience.\nHow to edit for clarity:\nUnderstand Your Audience: Before you begin the editing process, clearly understand your target audience. Are you writing for technical experts, beginners, or a mixed audience? Knowing your audience knowledge level, interests, and expectations is the first step in editing for clarity.\nSimplify Technical Jargon: Technical documentation often contains specialized terminology and jargon unfamiliar to non-experts. Edit by explaining technical terms and consider using simpler synonyms. Clarity helps you strike a balance between technical accuracy and accessibility.\nOrganization and Structure: Review the organization and structure of the document. Ensure the logical presentation of information. Headings and subheadings help readers navigate through the content. Group related information and use a clear hierarchy to show the relationships between sections.\nConsistency: Consistency in terminology, style, and formatting is essential for clarity. Ensure the consistent use of the same terms throughout the documentation. Formatting elements such as fonts, headings, and lists should follow a uniform style.\nActive Voice: Active voice sentences are more direct and easier to understand. Passive voice may make sentences more complex and less clear. Editing for clarity ensures the use of active voice in your sentences.\nAvoid Ambiguity: Ambiguity can lead to confusion. Review your content for ambiguous terms, phrases, or sentences. Be explicit in your explanations, and avoid leaving room for multiple interpretations. If there\u0026rsquo;s room for misunderstanding, clarify.\nVisual Aids: Consider using visual aids like diagrams, charts, and illustrations. These help clarify complex concepts and make the content more accessible. Ensure proper labeling of visual aids and integration into the text.\nExamples and Analogies: Provide real-world examples and analogies to explain technical concepts. Analogies bridge the knowledge gap and make abstract or complex ideas more relatable.\nRevision and Iteration: Editing for clarity is an iterative process. After making initial edits, revisit the document multiple times to refine and enhance its clarity. Each revision brings the content closer to your clarity goals.\nOriginal: The new software update has implemented changes to the user interface, providing users with a more seamless and user-friendly experience. Clarity Edit: The latest software update has improved the user interface, making it more seamless and user-friendly. Notice how clarity edit gave better understanding and easy readability to the text.\nBy applying these principles and techniques, you can effectively edit technical documentation for clarity, making it more accessible and understandable for your intended readers, regardless of their level of technical expertise. Clarity in technical documentation is vital to its usability and effectiveness.\nConciseness Conciseness refers to the quality of expressing ideas in a precise manner without unnecessary elaboration or redundancy. Concise technical documentation conveys information using the most efficient/effective language, avoiding unnecessary words or details that do not contribute to the main message.\nEditing for conciseness is also an essential aspect of creating better technical documentation. A concise document is more engaging, easier to read, and communicates information more efficiently.\nHow to edit for conciseness:\nIdentify Redundant Information: Review your document to identify redundant content. Check for repeated information, ideas, and unnecessary phrases and eliminate redundancy to make the document more concise.\nRemove Unnecessary Words: Carefully examine each sentence and paragraph to identify and remove unnecessary words. Examples include filler words, redundant adjectives, and overly complex sentence structures. Simplify sentences to convey the same meaning with fewer words.\nAvoid Wordiness: Check for wordy phrases you can shorten without losing meaning. For example, replace\n\u0026ldquo;due to the fact that\u0026rdquo; with \u0026ldquo;because\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;in order to\u0026rdquo; with \u0026ldquo;to.\u0026rdquo; Reducing wordiness is a quick way to increase conciseness.\nUse Active Voice: Passive voice sentences are wordier than active voice sentences. Rewrite passive voice sentences to make them active. It shortens sentences and makes them more direct and engaging.\nCut Down on Qualifiers: Qualifying words and phrases like \u0026ldquo;very,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;extremely,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;quite,\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;somewhat\u0026rdquo; can often be eliminated without affecting the meaning of a sentence. Reducing qualifiers leads to more concise and assertive statements.\nCondense Lists: Lists may become lengthy and cumbersome. Edit lists to be more concise by\nRemoving unnecessary items, Combining related items, Presenting the information in a more organized format, such as a table or chart. Use Abbreviations and Acronyms Judiciously: Abbreviations and acronyms help reduce the length of technical terms. However, carefully use them and ensure it suits your target audience. Always spell out the full term on first time and include the abbreviation in parentheses. An example is the Technical Writing Mentorship Program (TWMP).\nFocus on Key Information: Prioritize the most critical information and eliminate less vital details. Your documentation should deliver the essential information without overwhelming the reader.\nUse Bullet Points and Headings: Bullet points and headings can break up dense paragraphs and provide concise, organized information. Use them to present key points and create a visually appealing document.\nExample of editing for conciseness;\nOriginal: It is important to note that the primary reason for the increase in sales is due to the fact that our marketing strategies have been highly effective. Conciseness Edit: The increase in sales is primarily due to our highly effective marketing strategies. Notice how concise edit eliminated unnecessary words/information and made the content more direct. to the text.\nEditing for conciseness is a better balance between preserving essential information and removing unnecessary content. A concise document saves the writer and the reader time and enhances the documentation overall readability and impact.\nCorrectness (Accuracy) Correctness refers to the quality or state of being accurate, free from errors, and following established standards, rules, or facts. In technical documentation, correctness is a measure of accuracy and appropriateness.\nEditing for correctness is another critical aspect of technical documentation. Ensuring the information in your documentation is precise and error-free is essential to maintain the credibility of the content.\nHow to edit for correctness:\nFact-Checking: Verify the accuracy of data, statistics, references, and any technical details. Ensure the information is up-to-date and consistent with current knowledge and industry standards.\nCross-Reference Sources: If your document cites external sources or references, cross-reference these sources to confirm the accuracy of the information. Check that citations are correctly formatted and lead to the intended source.\nCheck Technical Details: Pay close attention to technical details. Double-check codes, calculations, formulas, and specific measurements to ensure accuracy. Even minor errors in technical details have significant consequences.\nGrammar and Syntax: Accurate grammar and syntax are essential for clear and precise communication. Review the document for grammatical errors, such as subject-verb agreement, verb tense consistency, and sentence structure. Incorrect grammar can lead to misunderstandings.\nCheck Spelling and Typographical Errors: Even a single typographical error casts doubt on the accuracy of your document. Proofread the document carefully to catch spelling mistakes and typographical errors. Spelling errors can change the meaning of a word or term, leading to confusion.\nMaintaining accuracy in technical documentation is paramount, as errors lead to misunderstandings, misinterpretations, or potentially dangerous consequences. Thoroughly editing for accuracy helps ensure your document is a reliable and trustworthy source of information.\nExample of editing for correctness;\nOriginal: The experiment was conducted on April 25th, 2022, and the results were published in the June 2022 edition of the journal. Correctness Edit: The experiment was conducted on April 25, 2022, and the results were published in the June 2022 edition of the journal. Notice how correctness edit ensured the document is accurate and free from errors.\nEditing improves the quality of your technical documentation, making it a valuable resource that communicates concisely and accurately to your target audience.\nThe next module explores in-depth the use of diagrams in technical documentation.\n","date":"2023-08-07","id":24,"permalink":"/docs/technicalwritingcourse/editing/","summary":"Editing is a vital aspect of the technical writing process.

Formatting covers a wide range of things, including font size, font selection, lists, indentation, margins, alignment, spacing, etc. Technical documents must be reader-centered.\nThe information should be explained and presented in a style that is readable and easy to understand. Formatting is one of the core elements of all technical documents. A format should show a hierarchical structure of information that guides the reader through the text. Regarding technical writing, ensuring that the document is reader-friendly and follows a clear organizational pattern is important.\nThink of it like visiting a friend\u0026rsquo;s apartment or going on vacation, where everything is in the wrong place. It can be frustrating and confusing to navigate through. Similarly, if a technical document is not properly formatted, it can be difficult for readers to understand the content.\nCertain guidelines should be followed to write a well-formatted and reader-centered technical document.\nThe information should be presented in a style that is easy to read and understand. Formatting is one of the core elements of all technical documents, and it should show a hierarchical structure of information that guides the reader through the text.\nCommon formatting elements for technical documentation: Headings Most technical articles and documents follow a particular hierarchy from introduction to conclusion. Often, the structure depends on the type of article or technical document.\nHeadings and subheadings are important elements of technical writing. They make your content more organized and help your readers navigate through what you have written.\nProper use of headings and subheadings increases the accessibility of your documents. One very important practice is writing descriptive and concise headings highlighting each section\u0026rsquo;s main idea\nHeadings are really important features in technical writing; they alert your readers about upcoming topics and subtopics and help readers skip and go to what they are interested in, in the case of long technical articles or documentation.\nHeadings can help you organize your content into large sections [major headings] and smaller sections [sub-headings]. Headings are formatted by level [first level, second level, third level], which can vary in position and formatting.\nAvoid using vague headings that do not convey any specific information. Headings should clearly state what your readers should expect from your content. Additionally, keywords in your headings help you optimize your technical document or article for search engines.\nKey Guidelines for Headings Always make your headings descriptive; using headings like ‘’Django plugins” does not convey the right message. Your headings should inform the reader of the content of each section.\nAlways make headings parallel in phrasing. This helps readers know if the sections are similar to the preceding ones. It is always best practice to use parallel construction to structure the phrases similarly. If one headline begins with a verb, all headlines should also begin with a verb. Example; “Conquer Your New Year\u0026rsquo;s Resolutions with These Simple Tips”\nEnsure that your headings maintain consistency. Use type size, style, color, italics, alignment, bold, etc. These guidelines can help you design headings effectively.\nFormat headings so that they indicate their level. Always use a hierarchical format when writing headings; generally, first-level headings are larger and bolder than second and subsequent-level headings.\nAlways use a consistent style of capitalization. Headings can be capitalized using several approaches. It is important to note that the same capitalization style should be used for each heading and each subheading within the document.\nLevels Of Heading First Level Headings The first level heading is the highest or main level heading. It is usually best practice for first-level headings to be the largest and should be bold.\nLevel Two Headings The second level heading is a subheading of Level 1. Second-level headings are usually smaller and different from first-level headings. When formatting, it’s usually best practice to indent the heading and align the subsequent blocks of text.\nLevel Three Headings Level 3 is the subheading of Level 2. Third-level headings are usually smaller than level-two headings. It should either be italicized or indented.\nExamples of Good and Bad Heading Good headlines help you draw attention to your audience. Headings are a quick way to capture people’s attention and encourage them to read more.\nHere are examples of good and bad headings to illustrate key principles.\nGood Headings “Introduction to Data Analysis”\nIndicates the main topic section\n“Key Benefits of Eating Balanced Diets”\nconveys the main points to be discussed\n“Methods for improving productivity as a student”\nDescribes the section\u0026rsquo;s content and provides a clear focus\nBad Headings “Jewelry I found” Vague and lacks specificity, leaving readers uncertain about the content.\n“Chapter 1” Generic and Uninformative: readers can\u0026rsquo;t discern the content without more context\n“Random Stuffs” Similar to “Random Facts”, it lacks specificity and doesn’t guide the reader\nList In technical writing, it is important to convey information clearly and concisely. Using lists while writing can be a helpful tool in highlighting important points, properly structuring your paragraphs and sentences, and organizing your document.\nListing in technical writing can make a technical document more readable and simplified. Even with formatting a list correctly, your articles could be clearer to your readers. It is important to understand how to format a list properly.\nGuidelines for Creating Lists in Technical Writing Do not split a list over two pages; try as much as possible to ensure the list stays on one page.\nTry not to overuse lists; most importantly, a list should have complementary explanatory text to add more information about the list and its importance.\nEnsure that the first letter of each of the list items is capitalized.\nAt least 2-8 items should be included in a list; ensure that you have at least two items in a list, or it might not be considered a list. Also, having more than 8 items in a list is too much; if the information can be merged, it will make it readable and well formatted.\nAdd spacing to the list to enhance the readability of the technical documents.\nAlways use parallel phrasing / parallel construction.\nList Types Just as different items in a kitchen have different purposes, different kinds of lists also serve different purposes. In this section, we will look at five commonly used types of lists.\nBullet List Bullet lists are the most commonly used type of list. They typically emphasize two or more items when a specific order is unimportant.\nBullet lists can also add whitespace to a document to improve readability. However, they are generally short and should not be used for items longer than a few words.\nHere are some examples of how bullet lists can be used: To list the ingredients for a recipe To outline the steps in a procedure To summarize the key points of a presentation, To create a checklist of tasks Numbered List Numbered lists should be used when the order of the listed items is important, and ideas must be expressed in chronological order.\nFor example, numbered lists often provide instructions, outline steps in a process, or present a sequence of events. Use of numbered lists helps convey a sense of order and progression, making it easier for readers to follow the presented information. Here is a simple, numbered list providing a clear and concise set of instructions on baking cookies\nGather the necessary ingredients. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit. Combine the dry ingredients in a large bowl. In a separate bowl, cream the butter and sugar together. Beat in the eggs one at a time. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until combined. Stir in the vanilla extract. Drop rounded tablespoons onto ungreased baking sheets. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until golden brown. cool on baking sheets for a few minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely. For optimal clarity, strive to keep your numbered lists within eight items. Consider dividing your list into stages or phases if it exceeds eight items.\nSubsequently, review your documents and check for formatting to enhance readability.\nIn-sentence lists Sentence lists are typically employed when you have only two to four items and desire to preserve sentence structure and paragraphing. For instance, you could utilize a sentence list to list the ingredients for a simple recipe or the key points of a brief presentation.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s an example of a sentence list:\nThe ingredients for this recipe are flour, sugar, eggs, and milk. The key points of my presentation are the importance of communication, teamwork, and adaptability. As you can see, sentence lists allow you to maintain a cohesive flow while presenting a short list of items. Labeled lists Are employed when the listed items require further explanation or elaboration. For instance, you could utilize a labeled list to define key terms or outline the steps involved in a complex process.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s an example of a labeled list:\nComponents of a Computer: Hardware: the physical components of a computer, such as the CPU, RAM, and hard drive. Software: The programs that enable a computer to function, such as the operating system and application software. As you can see, labeled lists provide a clear and structured way to present information that requires additional explanation.\nNested Lists Nested lists are commonly used when list items have sub-lists, which are lists within a larger list. This structure can help organize and present complex information, particularly when hierarchical relationships between the items exist.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s an example of a nested list:\nFruit\nCitrus\nOrange\nLemon\nGrapefruit\nBerries\nRaspberry\nStrawberry\nBlueberry\nTropical\nMango\nPineapple\nBanana\nLists are crucial features of technical writing. They enhance readability, improve clarity, and ensure that ideas are conveyed accurately and effectively.\nLists break down complex information into digestible chunks, making it easier for readers to grasp and retain key points. They also help to organize and structure content, creating a logical flow that guides the reader through the material.\nTables A table is a structured arrangement of rows and columns that presents information in a tabular format. It is often used to present selection, comparison, or study information.\nWell-designed tables in technical writing can make information clear and readable and create a visual representation of results, making them more concise and organized.\nTables predominantly present numerical data, such as comparing characteristics like height and depth or listing product prices.\nTables contribute to the accuracy, completeness, and readability of technical documents. Each table should be accompanied by an introductory sentence that provides context and summarizes the information presented in the table.\nTables do make it easy to compare information. Tables can show trends or patterns of increasing or decreasing activity.\nA table consists of a group of rows and columns of data. At the top of each column is a column heading, which defines or identifies the contents of that column.\nAlong the left edge of the table, there may be row headings, which define or identify the contents of those rows.\nSteps to Prepare Tables in a Technical Document Identify your audience\nWrite a clear outline\nCreate a template for your table\nDesign the Table Layout\nDetermine the Number of Columns Required\nSelect appropriate cell borders\nChoose an appropriate font style that will be used across the documents\nAdd text elements\nThe following guidelines will help you to create and format tables efficiently;\nFormatting Guidelines for Creating Tables Each column in a table should be properly labeled with a meaningful header.\nA table cell should not hold more than two sentences\nIntroduce each table with a sentence that tells the readers what the list or table represents.\nAlways use parallelism within individual columns.\nThe data in the table should be properly explained so that readers don’t find it difficult to understand.\nTables should be simplified to the amount of data that illustrates your point.\nA footnote proves useful for elaborating on specific aspects of one or more items in the table rather than cluttering the table with excessive information.\nAlways include enough data to illustrate your point without misrepresenting it.\nAn example of a table with appropriate introductory text and format\nTable 1: The following table identifies States and Capitals in Nigeria and Their Slogans with Current Governor S/N State Capital Slogan Current Governor 01 Abia Umuahia God’s Own State Alex Otti 02 Adamawa Yola Land of Beauty Ahmadu Umaru Fintiri 03 Akwa - Ibom Uyo Land of Promise Umo Eno In summary, tables should be introduced and referenced in the text beforehand. They should be numbered sequentially and have concise, descriptive, and easy-to-understand captions.\nFigures A figure can be considered any visual element or presentation incorporated into a technical document. Figures can encompass photographs, sketches, schematics, line graphs, and various other forms of visual representation.\nIn most instances, figures present data clearly and concisely. When the need arises to convey quantitative information in a visually appealing way, figures should be employed to enhance the reader\u0026rsquo;s understanding and comprehension.\nFigures should be simple and clear; avoid adding borders, grid lines, background patterns, and 3-D effects.\nKey Guidelines for Figures Figures should exhibit high-quality image resolution, ensuring clarity and visual appeal.\nEach figure in a technical report should be assigned a unique identifier, enabling seamless referencing throughout the document.\nFigure 3.4.2 Sales Strategy for three demo projects about to be launched\nExamine Figure 3.4.2 has a unique identifier for easy reference.\nAll figure elements, including labels, captions, and legends, should incorporate a combination of letters and numbers to ensure unambiguous identification and reference throughout the technical document.\nFigures should be simplified and explanatory, enhancing the clarity and comprehension of the presented information.\nAvoid using overly complex or intricate figures that may obscure the intended message. Instead, opt for clear, concise, and well-organized figures that effectively convey the intended information to the reader.\nUtilize contemporary tools to produce engaging visuals that improve technical writing. Take advantage of the features of Microsoft Office and other specialized software to design graphics that are visually attractive but also informative and efficient in communicating intricate technical ideas.\nAdd a clear, concise, and descriptive image description, and include all necessary information.\nTake a close look at Figure 3.5.2 below. Do you understand what information it conveys?\nFigure 3.5.2\nIf you take a closer look at Figure 3.5.2, you can interpret the image. However, the lack of a descriptive caption makes it difficult to be certain.\nFigure 3.5.3 A Budget Bar Chart showing the percentage of T-shirt sales\nFigure 3.5.3 has a numbered caption and a descriptive title. With this added information, the reader will have a clearer and more informative view of the figure.\nTypes of Figures There are many types of figures in technical writing, including but not limited to.\nDiagrams: They are often used to represent a model or an object. These images can be manually designed or drawn using computer software. Diagrams represent objects such as buildings, vehicles, and tools.\nFlow Chart: They are visual representations used to document and design processes or programs. It is also a pictorial representation of a process in sequential order.\nPie Chart: They are graphics often used to communicate varying percentages or values to each other.\nHistogram: A histogram is a graphical representation that organizes a group of data points into user-specified ranges.\nImages As a technical writer, you aim to craft clear, understandable, and readable documents. The goal is to provide your readers with the best possible assistance for using a product.\nOne excellent way to achieve this is by incorporating images into your writing. These images may include photos, screenshots, graphics, and illustrations. Visual integration enhances your ability to create seamless, clear, concise documentation.\nImages improve content clarity, particularly when writing installation guides, instruction manuals, or introducing new products.\nImages are truly essential in technical writing, as they significantly enhance the clarity and approachability of technical documents.\nFor some readers, text-heavy articles can be challenging to engage with. Incorporating images can significantly improve the understandability and visual appeal of your content.\nIncorporating screenshots of the process enhances clarity and comprehension when crafting technical documents, such as user manuals, how-to guides, or release notes.\nWhen guiding a user to use a new application, it is important to ensure the instructions are clear and easy to understand. One effective way to achieve this is using images to support the text.\nOutlining the steps without an image might not be as descriptive and understandable as one with an image. Images can help users visualize what they are expected to do, making it easier to follow the instructions.\nExample 1 To seamlessly utilize this app, follow these steps:\nNavigating the Home Screen: The initial screen presents various sections allowing you to select a class based on your preferred subject.

Images make the content easier to understand, and they aid in the speed at which the information presented is processed.\nIt also makes complex documentation clear and concise. How and where you will use images in your documentation depends on many elements.\nIndeed, images and illustrations can greatly enhance the clarity and understanding of technical documentation.\nHowever, it is important to note that there may be restrictions on using images in certain technical documents, particularly if they contain sensitive or confidential information.\nCreating professional-quality images for technical documentation often requires specialized tools and expertise that may only be available to some.\nTranslating illustrations can be costly, so it is important to carefully consider the need for images before incorporating them into a technical document.\nGeneral Guidelines to Consider While Adding an Image to a Technical Document The following guidelines are best practices for adding an image to your article.\nThe image included should be relevant to the steps you are trying to clarify.\nEnsure you add a description and reference an image before its placement.\nAlways use appropriate and descriptive captions and labels\nAlways credit image owners and use an image containing copyrighted information\nAlways add clear images, especially while adding screenshots, either in a technical manual or release note; endeavor to use a screenshotting tool to get good screenshots.\nPictures in Documentation; “The What and What not” Best Practices for Adding Images to Technical Documentation\nImages are an essential part of technical documentation, as they can help illustrate complex concepts or procedures and provide additional information that may not be easily conveyed through text.\nHere are some best practices for adding images to technical documentation:\nChoose the right image format: When selecting an image format, consider the type of image you are working with and its intended use. Common image formats in technical documentation include JPEG, PNG, and GIF. JPEGs are best for photographs, while PNGs and GIFs are better suited for screenshots or diagrams.\nOptimize image size and resolution: Keep image sizes as small as possible without compromising quality. Large images can slow down the loading time of online documentation, while overly compressed images can affect their clarity and readability. As a general rule of thumb, aim for a resolution of 72 dpi for web-based documentation and 300 dpi for print.\nUse descriptive image titles and alt text: Provide descriptive titles for images that accurately reflect their contents. This can help users quickly identify the image\u0026rsquo;s purpose and relevance. Additionally, provide alternative text (alt text) for each image to ensure accessibility for visually impaired users.\nPlace images near relevant text: Place them near the relevant text or instructions they illustrate to ensure that images are helpful and not confusing. This will help users understand the relationship between the image and the text and avoid confusion.\nLabel images clearly: Use labels or captions to provide additional context or information about an image. For example, if you use a screenshot to illustrate a process, label each step with a descriptive caption.\nUse consistent formatting: To ensure consistency throughout your documentation, use the same formatting for all images. This includes size, resolution, and placement.\nBy following these best practices, you can ensure that images in your technical documentation are clear, helpful, and effective in conveying complex information.\nHow to use formatting to improve the readability and clarity of your technical documentation Readability is simply communicating ideas in a clear and accessible way.\nConsistency is very important in technical writing. You should use uniform styles, sizes, and formats for all elements to make your document easy to read and understand. Creating a hierarchy with fonts, colors, and alignment is also crucial in technical writing. It helps readers quickly scan the document and find the necessary information.\nAnother important thing you should consider is your audience. Always tailor your content to your readers and understand who you\u0026rsquo;re writing for. This will help you determine the appropriate language, tone, and level of technicality to use in your document.\nOrganizing your content in a hierarchical format is also essential. Creating an outline is a key tool for organization in technical writing. It helps you to organize your content and create an easier user experience for your readers.\nFinally, simplicity is key in technical writing. Always use clear and straightforward language and write short sentences. This will help you convey your information concisely and ensure your readers can easily understand your content.\n","date":"2023-08-07","id":25,"permalink":"/docs/technicalwritingcourse/formatting/","summary":"Module content Headings Example of good and bad headings Lists Tables Figures and Images How to use formatting to improve the readability and clarity of your technical documentation Formatting - Definition Formatting refers to how visually organized a document is arranged on the page.","tags":[],"title":"Formatting"},{"content":"","date":"0001-01-01","id":26,"permalink":"/docs/technicalwritingcourse/","summary":"","tags":[],"title":""},{"content":"","date":"0001-01-01","id":27,"permalink":"/categories/","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Categories"},{"content":"","date":"0001-01-01","id":28,"permalink":"/contributors/","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Contributors"},{"content":"","date":"0001-01-01","id":29,"permalink":"/tags/","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Tags"}]
