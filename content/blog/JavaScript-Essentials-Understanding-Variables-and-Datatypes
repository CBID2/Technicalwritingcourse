## Introduction

JavaScript is a popular, verstile programming language that allows developers to create dynamic and interactive online applications. Variables and data types are two key elements in JavaScript that are required for storing and manipulating information within your code.
This article will go over variables in detail, how to declare and assign values to them, as well as the various data types available and how to use them effectively. Mastering these ideas provides a solid basis for creating powerful and efficient JavaScript applications.

## Understanding Variables

Variables acts as a container that holds and stores data for later use. They allow you to assign names to values, thereby, making your code more readable and maintainable.
The `Var`, `Let` and `Const` keywords are used to declare variables. They hold different data types such as numbers, string, booleans, arrays, objects, and more. Now, let's take a look at each one.

### 1. Var

The `Var` keyword is an old method of declaring a variable and it's not recommended due to its hoisting and scope concerns. Using `Var` can lead to accidental reassignment of variables. 

```
var x = 5;
var name = "Sophie";

```

```
var x = 10;
var y = 20;
var z = x + y;
var name = "Dave";

console.log(x);    // 10
console.log(y);   // 20
console.log (z);  // 30
console.log(name);  // Dave

```

### 2. Let

The `let` keyword  is the most common way of declaring a variable. This keyword is a good choice for declaring variables whose values will be reassigned.

```
let color = "Red";
color = "Blue";  // values can be reassigned

console.log (color);  // Blue

```

```
let x = 10;
let y = 20;
let z = x + y;

console.log(x);    // 10
console.log(y);   // 20
console.log (z);  // 30
```

### 3. Const

The `const` keyword is used to create variables whose values you won't reassign. They are useful for variables that should remain constant throughout their lifetime. This helps prevent accidental changes to your code and improves code maintainability.
Note that values of variables declared with `const` can't be changed.

```
const pi = 3.14159;

console.log(pi); // 3.14159

```

<ins class="adsbygoogle"
     style="display:block"
     data-ad-client="ca-pub-5378239849378753"
     data-ad-slot="6682693300"
     data-ad-format="auto"
     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins>

<script>
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
</script>

## Understanding Data Types
Data Types are another fundamental building blocks of JavaScript. The most common ones are the primitive and complex data types.
The primitive data types consists of Number, String, Boolean, BigInt, Null and  Undefined while the Complex data types consist of but not limited to  Arrays and Objects.

### Primitive Data types

#### Number : Numeric values
Number represents numerical values. They could be intergers or floating-point numbers and are also used to perform mathematical operations.

```
let person1Age = 16;
let person2Age = 20;
let pi = 3.14159
let totalAge = person1Age + person2Age;

console.log (person1Age);  // 16
console.log(person2Age);   // 20
console.log (pi); // 3.14159
console.log(totalAge);  //36

```

In a E-commerce, you can use Numbers to calculate product prices, discount etc.

{{< /callout >}}

#### String : Textual data
String represent sequences of characters and textual data. They must be enclosed within a single (' ') or double (" ") quotes.

``` 
let name = "Patricia Lawson";
let greeting = "Hello, world!";

console.log(name); // Patricia Lawson
console.log(greeting); // Hello, world!

```

{{< callout context="note" title="Use case" icon="rocket" >}}

 In a To-do application, you can use String to store the To-do tasks.

{{< /callout >}}


#### Booleans : True or False 
Booleans represents logical values either `true` or `false`.  The are often used for conditional statements and logical operations. `true` means "yes or correct", and `false` means "no or incorrect"

```
let isWeekend = true;
let isRaining= false;

```

{{< callout context="note" title="Use case" icon="rocket" >}}

In a Social media application, you can use Boolean to determine if the user is a female or male when creating a profile.

{{< /callout >}}

#### BigInt : large Integers
BigInt are used to store numbers that are too large to be stored in the `Number` data type. They provide precise calculation for large intergers. To create a `BigInt`, add n to the end of an integer or call `BigInt()`

```
let largeNumber = 123456789023456789098765432155575643213456789n;
let y = BigInt (12345678909876543213456788904567890643224566788)

console.log(largeNumber); //  123456789023456789098765432155575643213456789
console.log(y); // 12345678909876543213456788904567890643224566788
```

{{< callout context="note" title="Use case" icon="rocket" >}}

 In a financial application, you can use BigInt to store values that are too big to be stored in Number.

{{< /callout >}}



#### Null :  Absence of a value
Null is used to explicitly state the intentional absence of a value. It represents "nothing ", "empty" or "unknown value".

```
let emptyValue = null;

console.log(emptyValue); // null

```
{{< callout context="note" title="Use case" icon="rocket" >}}

Imagine you're building a form where users can enter their informations . You can use Null to indicate the user chose not to answer a particular question.

{{< /callout >}}

#### Undefined :  Uninitialized variable
Undefined represents variable that has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value. 

``` 
let name;

console.log(name);  //  undefined

```
{{< callout context="note" title="Use case" icon="rocket" >}}

Imagine you're building an E-commerce website, when a user registers but hasn't completed their profile, their profile information could be undefined.

{{< /callout >}}

### Complex Data types

#### Arrays : Ordered collections
Arrays are used to store and manipulate mutiple values in a specific order.  Each of these value is termed an element, and the each of these elements can be accessed using their index number, which starts from 0, because they are zero-indexed.

``` 
let fruits = ["Strawberry", "Watermelon", "Grapes"];

console.log(fruits[0]); //Strawberry
console.log(fruits[1]); //Watermelon
console.log(fruits[2]); //Grapes

```
{{< callout context="note" title="Use case" icon="rocket" >}}

Imagine you want to create a simple application that allows a user to input their favourite fruits. You can use a JavaScript Arrays to store the fruits.

{{< /callout >}}


#### Objects : Unordered collections
Objects are unordered collections of key-value pairs used to store data in a structured way and each of these key-value pair is termed a property. Objects also allows you to store different data types and the properties can be acessed using the properties names.

``` 
let person = {
  name: "Doris",
  age : 18,
  isFemale : true,
  country : "Nigeria"
};

console.log(person.name);  // Doris
console.log(person.age);  // 18
console.log(person.isFemale);  // true
console.log(person.country);  // Nigeria

```
{{< callout context="note" title="Use case" icon="rocket" >}}

 In an online store project, you might represent the product information as an Object, containing properties such as name of product, price, description, quantity available etc.

{{< /callout >}}
