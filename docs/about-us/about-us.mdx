Our program is designed for individuals looking to improve their technical writing skills and advance their careers in software development, community management, and developer advocacy.

Participants will be matched with experienced technical writers who mentor them, providing guidance and feedback on their writing projects.

The mentors will share their knowledge of industry-specific terminology and best practices and offer tips on explaining complex technical concepts in simple terms.

Participants will work on real-world writing projects throughout the program, such as documentation, tutorials, and blog posts.

They will also have access to various resources and tools, including templates, style guides, and documentation software.

The program is flexible and can be tailored to fit each participantâ€™s schedule and goals. It will run for a period of 12 weeks, with weekly check-ins and progress reports.
