API specifications are crucial. They provide standard rules and guidelines for integrating an API and serve as a single source of truth for software engineers.

## What is API Specification?

An API specification is a standardized format that describes the behavior and elements of an API, ensuring clear communication and integration among developers. 

The specification describes endpoints, operations on each endpoint, query and path parameters, methods, schemas, version descriptions, and more.

All these elements are compiled into a specification file, which is usually created during the development stage of the API. However, APIs with predefined specifications by governing bodies are exceptions.

API specifications are technical and often lack detailed explanations, requiring technical writers to provide comprehensive descriptions translated into API documentation. While specifications outline API elements, they don't instruct on usage.

## Why do you need an API Specification?

An API specification offers clear, standardized guidelines detailing how an API should operate and interact with other software components. It ensures consistent communication by defining expected behavior, data formats, and protocols. This eliminates the need for developers to rely on internal implementation details.

**Moving further,** a well-defined API specification fosters collaboration among teams. 
It minimizes misunderstanding and reduces the time spent on API integration.

**In addition**, an API specification serves as a single source of truth that can be easily shared and modified, simplifying the development process. **As a result**, integration becomes significantly easier when APIs are clearly defined. Third-party developers can integrate their products seamlessly by referring to the specifications rather than relying on trial and error.

**Finally**, security is essential in API development. An API specification enables developers to implement essential security measures, such as authentication, rate limiting, and encryption, to protect sensitive data.


## Types of API Specification

There are various types of API specifications with different formats

1. Open API Specification(OAS)
2. Restful API Modelling Language(RAML)
3. API Blueprint
4. [GRAPHQL Schema Definition Language](https://spec.graphql.org/June2018/)(SDL)
5. [Web Application Description Language](https://www.w3.org/TR/2001/NOTE-wsdl-20010315)(WADL)

This section will focus on the first three API specification types.

### Open API Specification

[OAS](https://swagger.io/specification/), previously known as the Swagger specification, is a format for describing, producing, consuming, and visualizing restful web services. It evolved from the Swagger framework and is now managed by the Open API Initiative(OAI) under the Linux Foundation.  It is an open-source collaboration project of the Linux Foundation.

This specification defines the structure and syntax of REST APIs, making it easy for developers to build consistent APIs that adhere to Industry standards. One of the most significant advantages of open APIs is that they are language agnostic. This means that humans and computers can identify and understand service capabilities without requiring additional documentation or access to source code.

An Open API file, sometimes called an Open API document, describes an API, including endpoints, authentication methods, operation parameters, and contact information. It can be written in YAML or JSON. Big organizations like Google, Postman, Oracle, and more use the OAS.

- **openapi**: This section specifies the version of the OAS. The OAS has different versions.

:::tip
You can write your OAS in YAML or JSON. I will use YAML for the example descriptions. One thing you should know about YAML is that it is indentation-sensitive.
:::

 
```yaml showLineNumbers
openapi: 3.0.0
```
- **info**: This section provides metadata about the API, including title, description, version, contact, license, etc. It gives a general overview of what the API does.

```yaml showLineNumbers

```


- **servers**: This section defines the base URLs for accessing the API. You can add multiple server URLs, such as production and testing environments, as supported by [OAS 3.0](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/releases/tag/3.0.0-rc2)
```yaml showLineNumbers 
    servers:
      - url: 'https://petstore.swagger.io/v2'
```


- **tags:** This section contains a collection or group of related operations. Tags can also be added to path operations to add clear descriptions. For example, the [pet store API](https://petstore.swagger.io/#/) has tags like user, pet, store, and more.
```yaml showLineNumbers
tags:
  - name: pet
    description: Everything about your Pets
```
- **paths**: This section lists all the API paths/endpoints available and the HTTP methods supported for each path. It contains request and response objects.

```yaml showLineNumbers

#### **0AS Tools**

- [**SwaggerHub**:](https://app.swaggerhub.com/home) SwaggerHub is a collaborative platform developed by SmartBear that allows teams to design, manage, and publish APIs using the OAS. It offers a premium version of the open-source Swagger tools, providing enhanced features for API documentation. 

- [**PostMan**](https://identity.getpostman.com/login?addAccount=1): This tool allows users to import APIs created with Swagger and other OpenAPI specifications.

- [**Swagger Codegen:**](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-codegen/) Swagger Codegen is a tool that generates client libraries, server stubs (generated code), and API documentation from an OpenAPI Specification.

Other tools include:  Open API generator, API Dog, and more.

### RAML Specification

RAML, which stands for **RESTful API Modeling Language**, is a specification language designed to describe RESTful APIs in a structured and human-readable format. It utilizes **YAML** (YAML Ain't Markup Language) as its syntax, making it accessible for developers and non-developers to understand and use.

The language's focus on modeling rather than documenting APIs has set it apart from other specifications like OAS. This distinction has led many organizations to adopt RAML for their API design processes, particularly during the early stages of development.

With the rise in adoption of the OAS, RAML is no longer popular.

**Brief History of RAML**

RAML was first introduced in 2013. Its goal was to provide a more effective way to design APIs compared to existing standards like Swagger (now OpenAPI). It was developed to facilitate API design rather than document existing APIs.

Moving on, in 2015, the Open API Initiative was established under the Linux Foundation to standardize HTTP API descriptions. While RAML was considered, Swagger became the primary focus of this initiative.

A year later, on May 16, 2016, the latest major release of RAML, version 1.0, was launched. This version introduced several enhancements aimed at improving usability and modularity.


#### Basic Structure of a RAML Specification

A basic RAML specification starts with a version declaration, followed by metadata about the API, and then the definition of resources and their associated methods. Here’s a breakdown of the specification structure.


- **Version Declaration:** In RAML, you must define the version of the document.

```{1} showLineNumbers
#%RAML 1.0   
```

- **Metadata:** This section contains detailed information about the API, such as the title, version, and base URL.

```{1-4} showLineNumbers
title: e-BookMobile API
    baseUri: http://api.e-bookmobile.com/{version}
    version: v1

```
    


- **Resource Definition:** Resources represent the various API endpoints. Each resource is defined with a leading slash and can have nested resources.
```{1-3} showLineNumbers
 /users:
    /authors:
    /books:
```
   


- **Method:** Each resource supports various HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), which are defined under their respective resources.
```{1-2} showLineNumbers
 /books:
      get:
```


- **Query Parameter:** In RAML, you can define query parameters for a resource or method to filter, sort, or paginate the returned data.
```{1-27} showLineNumbers
 /books:
       get:
        queryParameters:
          author:
            displayName: Author
            type: string
            description: An author's full name
            example: Mary Roach
            required: false
          publicationYear:
            displayName: Pub Year
            type: number
            description: The year released for the first time in the US
            example: 1984
            required: false
          rating:
            displayName: Rating
            type: number
            description: Average rating (1-5) submitted by users
            example: 3.14
            required: false
          isbn:
            displayName: ISBN
            type: string
            minLength: 10
            example: 0321736079
            required: false

```
   

- **Responses:** Responses define the expected outcomes of API calls, including HTTP status codes and response bodies.
```{1-21} showLineNumbers
 /{bookTitle}:
        get:
          description: Retrieve a specific book title
          responses:
            200:
              body:
                application/json:
                  example: |
                    {
                      "data": {
                        "id": "SbBGk",
                        "title": "Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers",
                        "description": null,
                        "datetime": 1341533193,
                        "genre": "science",
                        "author": "Mary Roach",
                        "link": "http://e-bookmobile.com/books/Stiff"
                      },
                      "success": true,
                      "status": 200
                    }

```

### API Blueprint Specification

[API Blueprint](https://apiblueprint.org/documentation/tutorial.html) is a high-level API specification language designed for creating and documenting web APIs. It uses a syntax similar to Markdown, known as MSON (Markdown Syntax for Object Notation), which makes it easy for humans to read and write while still being processable by machines.

API Blueprint is ideal for projects that need clear documentation and rapid prototyping. The file is saved with a .apib extension.

#### Basic Structure of an API Blueprint Specification


- **Metadata**: This section includes general information about the API, such as its title, version, and other basic information.
```{1-2} showLineNumbers
  FORMAT: 1A
    HOST: https://polls.apiblueprint.org/
```

  
- **API Name & Overview Section: This section** briefly describes the API, including its name and purpose.
```{1-3} showLineNumbers
    # Poll API
    Polls is a simple API allowing consumers to view polls and vote in them.
    
```
- **Resource Group Section**: These sections group related resources together.

```{1} showLineNumbers
  
    ## Questions Collection [/questions]
    

```

- **Action Sections**: Define the actions that can be performed on resources, such as HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.). Each action section can specify requests, responses, headers, and more. 
```{1-74} showLineNumbers
 ### List All Questions [GET]
    
    + Response 200 (application/json)
    
            [
                {
                    "question": "Favourite programming language?",
                    "published_at": "2015-08-05T08:40:51.620Z",
                    "choices": [
                        {
                            "choice": "Swift",
                            "votes": 2048
                        }, {
                            "choice": "Python",
                            "votes": 1024
                        }, {
                            "choice": "Objective-C",

                        }
                    ]
                }
            ]



    ### Create a New Question [POST]
    
    You may create your own question using this action. It takes a JSON
    object containing a question and a collection of answers in the
    form of choices.
    
    + Request (application/json)
    
            {

:::tip[Assignment]
Use a Swagger editor (like SwaggerHub, Editor.Swagger.io) to create an OpenAPI Specification (OAS) document for the TDMB API.
The document should include the following elements:
- Info: Basic information about the API (title, description, version, contact, license).
- Paths: Define the API endpoints and their supported HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
- Parameters: Describe query parameters, path parameters, and request bodies for each operation.
- Responses: Define the expected responses for each operation, including status codes and response schemas.
- Data Models: Create schemas to represent the data structures used by the API.
- Security: If authentication is required, specify the security scheme (e.g., API Key, OAuth2) and how it is used.

**Documentation Preview and Generation**: Use Swagger tools to preview the generated API documentation. This will give you an interactive view of the API, similar to what developers will see when using it.

Write a reflection on the experience of documenting the TDMB API using Swagger. Include the following:
- Challenges you faced.
- Key lessons learned about API documentation and Swagger.


Lastly, after review, tag @Technicalwrit6 on Twitter and LinkedIn, stating that this is your API Specification assignment.
