Building APIs that software products integrate is part of the software development process. A detailed and well-structured manual or guide on integrating the APIs is imperative. Thus, comprehensive API documentation is necessary for every organization and product that interacts with public or private APIs.

Imagine purchasing an LG smart TV without a manual or guide on how to set up and use the remote control. The experience would likely be frustrating and confusing, and the ability to use the TV would be limited. You may not understand how to navigate the settings or access its advanced functionalities, thus leading to a bad user experience.

This scenario illustrates the challenges developers encounter when APIs lack comprehensive documentation. Just as a manual enhances the usability of a television, API documentation is essential for enabling developers to leverage an API's full capabilities.

Many back-end developers struggle with writing detailed API documentation since not all developers are good writers. Whether you're new to API documentation as a technical writer or just trying to level up your skills, get your mind ready as I walk you through the basics of API documentation.

## What is API Documentation?

![What is API documentation](./img/what-is-api-docs.jpeg)
_**Fig.1**: What is API documentation_

API stands for application programming interface. API documentation is a form of [developer documentation](https://judy.hashnode.dev/what-is-developer-documentation-for-technical-writers#heading-types-of-developer-documentation). It is a detailed content, guide, manual, or reference to convey information to developers or the general public on integrating APIs into their applications.

This documentation contains endpoint descriptions, request and response examples, status codes, error messages, e.t.c

API documentation aims to ensure developers fully maximize an API's capabilities. The measure of maximizing an API capability is seen through the developer's ability to quickly understand the API and commence integration into their software applications or projects.

This reduces development time and enhances overall productivity. API documentation also serves as a reference manual for new and experienced API users, improving the developer experience and leading to higher adoption rates.

## Why Technical Writers are Essential for Great API Documentation

- Technical writers play a crucial role in delivering great API documentation. They combine their skills of writing clear and concise content with technical knowledge to structure and produce informative and easy-to-understand documentation.

- Technical writers leverage their communication skills with the project team to describe a broader sense of how developers could use the APIs.

- Not all developers are great writers. They do not consider the background and experience of their users. Technical writers, as opposed to developers, prioritize the user's needs.

- They consider their audience by asking questions like "Who is the target audience?" and "What information do users need to get started?" This focus aids in writing the documentation to meet the users' demands.

- Technical writers bridge the gap by explaining the technical jargon associated with APIs for easy comprehension. They can describe APIs in a way that resonates with the target audience, contributing to an API's success and adoption rate in the developer community.

- By taking over the documentation role, technical writers let developers do what they do best: writing code and improving the API.

## How Do APIs Work?

API acts as a middleman that allows different software applications to communicate and exchange data. This communication occurs in a request-response cycle. The players during this cycle are the client and server. The client could be a browser, mobile application, or web application, while the server is the backend where the business and application logic is written.

Where does the API come in? The API mediates between client and server by sending requests and returning responses.

![How API works](./img/how-api-works.png)
_**Fig.2**: How API works_

Using the analogy of a Dinner Reservation in a restaurant, **Joe (Client)** has a dinner reservation for three and would like to change it to six. Joe calls **customer service (API)** to place a request. The customer service person forwards the request to the **restaurant management (Server).** Restaurant Management provides food and services to the clients.

That is how an API works: In this case, the customer service acts like an API, an intermediary that processes requests and returns responses without ever having to see or deal with much of the complexity at the back end.

In software development, the client makes API calls to the server using a communication protocol such as the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). The API helps retrieve the information requested by the client from the server, which is like a resource center that stores different types of information.

## Types of APIs

API types can be categorized by access and function.

**By Access**

- **Public APIs:** Public APIs are open to anybody and are a great way to access data or functionality from another service. A few public APIs, such as the OpenWeatherMap API, have free and paid versions.
- **Partner APIs:** Partner APIs are exposed or made available to parties or organizations based on the relationship between the organization providing the API. These APIs are secured to ensure that only authorized partners can access them.
- **Internal APIs:** Internal APIs, also known as private APIs, are only used by a company's internal developers. They expose functionality within a company's system or application and are not meant for public use. For example, a company building a learning management system might have a private API that handles login functionality and another that handles private messaging on the system.

**By Function**

- **Hardware APIs:** Software applications can communicate with devices like sensors, cameras, or graphics cards through hardware APIs. These APIs provide low-level interactions between software applications and hardware, enabling data control and exchange.They also facilitate the development of software that can run on various hardware configurations. This is particularly important in environments with various devices, such as smartphones, tablets, and more. For example, a camera API would allow an application to take pictures.

- **Software Library APIs:** Software library APIs provide a standardized interface for developers to interact with and utilize a software library's functionality from their code. These APIs specify a set of methods, functions, classes, and attributes the library makes available for external use. The implementation details of a library are hidden. A developer can use previously existing code and functionality by importing these libraries without writing everything from scratch. For example, the Math Module library API in Python. This API consists of mathematical functions that perform basic operations such as addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (\*), and division(/). To use it, import the `math` module. Here's a simple example:

```python {1-5} showLineNumbers
    import math
    x = math.sqrt(64)

    print(x)  # output 8.0
```

- **Web APIs**: Web APIs are designed for use over the web. They use communication protocols like HTTP to allow applications to communicate and transmit data over a network. The most common type of API is web APIs, which power various applications such as social media apps, e-commerce websites, and mobile apps. They represent and transmit data in multiple formats, including JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) and XML (Extensible Markup Language).
