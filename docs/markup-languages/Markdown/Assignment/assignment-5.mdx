**Objective:** Create a Markdown page to showcase your portfolio, including the following sections:

- **About Me**: A brief introduction about yourself.
- **Projects**: A list of projects you have worked on with descriptions.
- **Skills**: A section highlighting your key skills.
- **Contact Information**: Details for getting in touch with you.
- **Images**: Showcase yourself with a professional image. Include images of your projects if possible.

1. **Instructions**:

    a. **Editor**: Use Visual Studio Code (VSCode) to write and preview your Markdown.

    b. **Testing Locally**: Make sure your Markdown file is rendered correctly by previewing it in VSCode. Test locally before submission.
  
    c. **Folder Structure**: Create a dedicated folder for this project. Name the folder `markdown-portfolio`, and inside it, create a `README.md` file, where all your portfolio content will go.

2. **Folder Structure Example**:

```bash showLineNumbers{1-7}
    markdown-portfolio/
    │
    └───README.md   # Your Markdown portfolio page
    └───images/     # Folder for images you want to showcase in the portfolio
        └───profile.jpg   # Example image for About Me
        └───project1.png  # Example image for a project
```
