**Objective:** Write a Markdown page for a recipe book that includes different categories such as appetizers, main courses, and desserts. Each recipe should include ingredients, instructions, and optional images.

- **Appetizers**: List and describe your favorite appetizers.
- **Main Courses**: Include main course recipes with detailed steps.
- **Desserts**: Add recipes for sweet treats.
- **Images**: Include images of the dishes if possible.

1. **Instructions:**

   a. **Editor**: Use Visual Studio Code (VSCode) to write and preview your Markdown.

   b. **Testing Locally**: Make sure your Markdown file is rendered correctly by previewing it in VSCode. Test locally before submission.
  
   c. **Folder Structure**: Create a folder named `markdown-recipe-book`, and inside it, create a `RECIPE_BOOK.md` file for your content and an `images/` folder for any recipe images.

2. **Folder Structure Example:**

```bash showLineNumbers{1-8}
    markdown-recipe-book/
    │
    └───RECIPE_BOOK.md   # Your Markdown recipe book page
    └───images/          # Folder for images of recipes
        └───bruschetta.jpg  # Example image for Bruschetta
        └───spaghetti.jpg   # Example image for Spaghetti Carbonara
```
