- Best tips and practices in markdown.
- Markdown style guides.
- Markdown tools (both web and desktop).

Let's get started!

## Introduction

Markdown like any other type of writing has rules and laws that guides its use. Writing practises against these rules can lead to an erroneous or disorganized documentation. Below are the best practises and tips to apply when working with markdown:

1. **Use headings and subheadings:**

Headings provide a way to arrange your content. It divides your document into digestible chunks that readers can easily read and understand. Using headings in markdown can help anyone reading the document navigate between sections and topics of choice.

Well written headings provide an insight into what the next set of paragraphs talk about. Sub-headings on the other hand are used to narrow-down each heading to its other component parts.

For example, a documentation/article on a video editing software named **VidEdit** will have headings and sub-headings as seen below:

``` markdown showLineNumbers{1-11}
   ## 1. What is VidEdit?

   ## 2. Features of VidEdit
   
   ### a. Download images with VidEdit
   
   #### i. Download images via URL.
    
   ### b. Extract audio from video
    
   ### c. Add audio to videos

   ## 3. VidEdit Integrations
   
   ### a. Integrate VidEdit with Youtube
   
   ### b. Integrate VidEdit with Tiktok
```

    ### c. Add audio to videos

    ## 3. VidEdit Integrations

</p>
</details>

From the headers above, readers can easily navigate between the sections that matter to them. The headings are written first, followed by the sub-headings. Each sub-heading has an extra hash (#) added to it. This helps to maintain a proper hierarchy of the content.

2. **Use whitespaces and line breaks:**

Whitespaces refer to the spaces between the words and paragraphs of your content. They help to separate words and paragraphs for easy comprehension and readability. However, whitespaces needs to be used carefully so your work doesn’t look vacant or over-spaced. Below is an example of a document with whitespaces defect like over-spacing and under-spacing:

``` markdown showLineNumbers{1-3}
Python is a high-level, interpretedprogramming language known for its simplicity andreadability.

It is widely used in various fields,  including webdevelopment, data science, artificial intelligence, and  more. Python's syntax allows programmers to write clear and  logical code for small and large-scale projects.
```

After writing, it is important to cross-check your document to spot and correct whitespace errors. Below is a correction of the document above:

``` markdown showLineNumbers{1-3}
  Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability.

   It is widely used in various fields, including web development, data science, artificial intelligence, and more. Python's syntax allows programmers to write clear and logical code for small and large-scale projects.
```

3. **Use descriptive texts for links and images:**

One of the ways to create a versatile and readable markdown file is by adding descriptive texts to links and images. These texts provide extra information about the link and image displayed. They are also used by search engines in indexing which can boost your content's search engine rankings (SEO).

Check the examples below:

``` markdown showLineNumbers{1-13}
   # Bad link text
   Facebook is a very popular messaging app. [click here](https://web.facebook.com/) to sign up.

   # Descriptive link text
   [Facebook](https://web.facebook.com/) is a very popular messaging app. You can create an account within 10 seconds.

   # Bad image text
   !\[Image\](image_link)

   # Descriptive image text
   !\[An image of a man carrying a dog\](image_link)
```

Check the preview below:

      #### Descriptive link text

    [Facebook](https://web.facebook.com/) is a very popular messaging app. You can create an account within 10 seconds.

</p>

4. **Escape special characters with backslash:**

In some cases, you may want to include special characters like asterisks (\*), hash(#), etc. in your markdown document. This can prove difficult since these special characters are also commands used in writing markdown. One way to solve this is by using a backslash (\). Below is an example:

``` markdown showLineNumbers{1-5}
   # The text below will be italicized
   *me and you*

   # The backslash prevents the text from being italicized
   \*me and you\*
```

Check the preview below:

<details>
  <summary>Preview</summary>
  <p>
     #### The text below will be italicized

     _me and you_
  
     #### The backlash prevents the text from being italicized

    \*me and you\*

</p>
</details>

5. **Use lists appropriately and consistently:**

Use the normal counting numbers (1, 2, 3, …) to create ordered lists, such as a step-by-step process. Use asterisks (\*) or dash (-) to create unordered lists. If you use asterisks (\*) to create a list in your first paragraph, consider using it throughout your document for consistency. The same thing applies to when you use a dash (-). Here is an example below:

``` markdown showLineNumbers{1-13}
  At the musical fest, we ate and drank the following:

  - fish
  - meat
  - wine
  - youghurts.

  There were also fun events like,

   - games
  - musical challenge
  - dance battle, etc.
```

6. **Edit tables for readability:**

Creating tables in markdown can be tricky, especially when each row and cells have words and characters of unequal length. To ensure readability of your markdown files, apply enough spaces to align each column with their respective data. Below is a comparison between a wrong table format and a readable one:

``` markdown showLineNumbers{1-12}
# Wrong table format
| Name | Email |
|---|---|
| Edun Rilwan | edun...@gmail.com |
| Oladapo Alex| alex...@gmail.com |

# Readable table format
| Name              | Email             |
| ---               | ---               |
| Edun Rilwan       | edun...@gmail.com |
| Oladapo Alexandra | alex...@gmail.com |
```

Check the preview below:

<details>
  <summary>Preview</summary>
  <p>
     #### Markdown table

     | Name              | Email             |
     | ----------------- | ----------------- |
     | Edun Rilwan       | edun...@gmail.com |
     | Oladapo Alexandra | alex...@gmail.com |

    _NOTE: Both format will render your table correctly. However, it is useful when editing your markdown file and sharing it with others.
Editors can quickly find out which column each row data belongs to._

7. **Using backticks for writing code:**

Markdown allows you to create code snippets using backticks (`). It’s usage can differ based on what you want to achieve. Below is a breakdown on how to use backticks in different scenarios:

```` markdown showLineNumbers{1-21}
# For a simple code or inline code
``your code goes here``

# For a code block or long code snippet

```
your code goes here
```

# Specify the programming language (1)
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3]
for n in numbers:
    print(n)
```

# Specify the programming language (2)
```javascript
const name = "Rilwan";
console.log(name);
```
````

Check the preview below:

<details>
  <summary>Preview</summary>
  <p>
     #### For a simple code or inline code

     `your code goes here`

     #### For a code block or long code snippet
    
      ```
      your code goes here

      ```
          #### Specify the programming language (1)

      ```python

          # Python

          numbers = [1, 2, 3]
          for n in numbers:
          print(n)
       ```

     #### Specify the programming language (2)

      ```javascript
        // Javascript

          const name = "Rilwan";
          console.log(name);
     ```

</p>
</details>

8. **Add metadata to your markdown file:**

When creating a markdown file for a blog post or documentation site, it is important to include a metadata that contains vital information about the file and its content. This piece of information is useful as it gives documentation sites, blogs, and markdown editors a summary of your file.

Metadata are included in a section of the markdown file called **Front matter.** It is always in the beginning of the markdown file and are enclosed by triple dashes (---). Below is an example of a metadata for a markdown file on **Introduction to Python**:

``` markdown showLineNumbers{1-8}
---
title: "Introduction to Python"
author: "Edun Rilwan"
date: "2024-08-03"
description: "An introductory guide to Python programming language, covering basic concepts and syntax."
tags: ["python", "programming", "beginner", "tutorial"] 
category: "Programming Tutorials"
---
```

9. **Using image as link text:**

This tip allows you to create a clickable image in markdown. This image is wrapped around a link which directs users to a new web page when it is clicked. Here is an example of how to implement it below:

``` markdown showLineNumbers{1-5}
   # Format
   [![Alt text](image_link)](link_url)

   # Sample Usage
   [![Django framework logo](https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/512/9307/9307630.png)](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/)
```

     [![Django framework icon](https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/512/9307/9307630.png)](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/)

     When you click on the image above, you will be redirected to django's official documentation.
