A popular **Static Site Generator (SSG)** that supports the use of AsciiDoc syntax is [Antora](https://antora.org/). [Static Site Generators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_site_generator) are tools that generate a full static HTML website based on raw data and a set of templates and Antora is one that has been designed specifically around the needs of technical writers and their goal; which is to create technical documentation.

Antora is developed around the AsciiDoc syntax or format that is somewhat similar to the [Markdown](https://technicalwritingmp.com/docs/markdown-course/introduction-to-markdown/) syntax. It also runs on [Asciidoctor](https://asciidoctor.org/), a processor that parses and converts AsciiDoc source documents into various formats such as HTML5, PDF, DocBook etc. It provides technical writers with a structured and defined way of organizing technical content.

It is important to note that the developers of Asciidoctor are also the maintainers of Antora, this gives room for proper integration between the two technologies.

To use Antora to generate a document, you need to assemble your files into a standard project structure, and then store them in a git repository. Once that is done, Antora picks your file and transforms it into a website.

Now you will take a look at how to Install Antora.

## Installation, Setup and Configuration

Before installing Antora locally on your computer, it is important to take a look at the [Supported Platforms and System Requirements](https://docs.antora.org/antora/latest/install/supported-platforms/#:~:text=Antora%20runs%20on%20Linux%2C%20macOS%2C%20and%20Windows.). This is to ensure your development device is supported by the system.

### Installing Node.js and Chocolatey for Windows

After checking for system requirements, you need to ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) installed on your computer. To check if you do, open the PowerShell and type:

```bash
node --version
```

You should see something like the image below ;

![PowerShell Installation](img\powershell-installation.png)

_**Fig 1.** An Image of the PowerShell showing the node version installed_

- **Pin 1** shows the command used to check if Node.js is installed.

- **Pin 2** shows the version of Node.js installed.

If you are presented with an error in your PowerShell after running the command, that would mean you do not have Node.js installed.

The best way to install to install Node.js is by [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/), a package manager for Windows. Open the PowerShell and run as an Administrator by right-clicking the PowerShell icon and selecting **Run as Administrator**.

Then run the following command;

```bash
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; iex ((New-Object System.Net.webClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))
```

{" "}

![PowerShell Processes](img\powershell-processes.png)

_**Fig 2:** A screenshot of the PowerShell showing the installation of Chocolatey_

Once the command is complete, you can now install node.js

You can install Node.js with Chocolatey by running the following command in the PowerShell;

```bash
choco install nodejs.install
```

### Installing Antora

In this section, you will learn how to install Antora.

:::info[Prerequisite]
You must have Node.js installed
:::

To use Antora to generate a documentation site, you need the **Antora command line interface (CLI)** and the **Antora site generator**.

1. Create a new directory for your documentation site, and then move into that directory. You can do this in your PowerShell. Let us call this directory _**test-site**_

```bash
mkdir test-site
cd test-site
```

2. Initialize the _package.json_ file and install the necessary CLI package in the project so you can run Antora using [Node Package Execute](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx) 

:::info
 npx: a npm package runner that executes any package from the npm registry without having to install it.

 :::

```bash
node -e "fs.writeFileSync('package.json', '{}')"
npm i -D -E antora
```

:::warning
In case you run into an error running the Antora installation script in the PowerShell of your Windows machine, refer to this article on [Execution Policies](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_execution_policies?view=powershell-7.4) to fix the issue.
:::

3. Verify Antora has been installed by running the command below;

```bash
npx antora -v
```

If the installation is successful, the version of Antora CLI and the site generator specified will be printed onto the PowerShell.

![PowerShell Installation](img\screenshotofpowershell.png)

_**Fig 4:** A screenshot of the PowerShell that shows the various processes discussed above_

From the screenshot above, you can see a visual breakdown of the Antora installation process in PowerShell. Below is an explanation of each highlighted section:

- **Pin 1:** Creation of the `test-site` directory  
  _Command used:_ `mkdir test-site`

- **Pin 2:** Navigating into the new directory  
  _Command used:_ `cd test-site`

- **Pin 3:** Initializing the project with a `package.json` and related files  
  _Command used:_ `npm init`

- **Pin 4:** Installing Antora as a dependency  
  _Command used:_ `npm install @antora/cli @antora/site-generator-default`

- **Pin 5:** Verifying the installed version and checking that Antora is working  
  _Command used:_ `npx antora --version`

## Creating a Playbook with IDE (Visual Studio Code)

To create a documentation site, Antora needs a playbook. you will look at how to do that in this section. Follow the following steps

**Step 1:** Using your preferred IDE, create a new file

**Step 2:** Add the following configuration information to the file and save it as **_antora-playbook.yml_**:

```yaml showLineNumbers
site:
  title: Antora Docs
  start_page: component-b::index.adoc
content:
  sources:
    - url: https://gitlab.com/antora/demo/demo-component-a.git
      branches: HEAD
    - url: https://gitlab.com/antora/demo/demo-component-b.git
      branches: [v2.0, v1.0]
      start_path: docs
ui:
  bundle:
    url: https://gitlab.com/antora/antora-ui-default/-/jobs/artifacts/HEAD/raw/build/ui-bundle.zip?job=bundle-stable
    snapshot: true
```

&nbsp;


![Antora Playbook](img\antora-playbook.png)

_**Fig 5:** A screenshot of an IDE showing the antora-playbook.yml file_

This configuration file will create a site using the [Antora demo repositories](https://gitlab.com/antora/demo).

**Step 3:** In the terminal, navigate to the _test-site_ directory

**Step 4:** Run the following command to generate your documentation site:

```
npx antora --fetch antora-playbook.yml
```

This command lets Antora clone the content, UI repository and generate your documentation site to the default output directory.

![Antora Terminal](img\Antora-Terminal.png)

_**Fig 6:** A screenshot from the terminal showing that the generation of the documentation site is complete_

Go to the **_test-site/build/site/index.html_** directory. Open the **_index.html_** file in your browser to view your generated documentation site.

**Step 5:** After opening the **_index.html_** file, you should see your generated documentation site.

_**Fig 7**: A screenshot of the generated Antora documentation site._

Congratulations, you just created your first documentation site with Antora.

## Testing your Documentation Site and Publishing with Antora

To publish and test your documentation site, you should do the following:

**Publishing with Antora**

1. In your already created folder, clone the content of this [Github repository](https://github.com/wise4rmgod/antora) into it. Once you have the repo cloned, now you can work locally on your pc.
2. Change into the antora directory and then initialize the json package and install antora by running the following commands;

```
node -e "fs.writeFileSync('package.json', '{}')"
npm i -D -E antora
```

3. Generate your site by running the following command;

```
npx antora antora-playbook.yml
```

4. Now your site should be generated and ready to be viewed. Copy the displayed URL, and paste it into your browser to view your generated site.

**Testing for Asciidoc syntax**

1. Go to the displayed folder below

<details>
<summary>Toggle to preview folder</summary>
  
  - antora/
    - docs/
      - modules/
        - module_one/

            - gettingstarted.adoc
            - installation.adoc
            - overview.adoc
  
</details>

2. In the **_gettingstarted.adoc_**, **_installation.adoc_** and **_overview.adoc_** files, copy and paste your AsciiDoc syntax into any of the files, then generate the site again by running the **_“npx antora antora-playboook.yml”_** command again.
3. Go to your browser, and refresh to see your AsciiDoc syntax displayed.

:::note
For any change you make with syntax in your vs code, always generate the site again by running the _“npx antora antora-playbook.yml”_ command.
