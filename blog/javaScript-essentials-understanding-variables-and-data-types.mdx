Are you a beginner in JavaScript looking to learn more about data types and variables? Look no further. This article will explain everything you need to know 
about variables and how to declare and assign values to them. 

You will also learn the various data types in JavaScript and how to use them effectively. 
Mastering these concepts  will provide you with a solid basis on how to create powerful and efficient JavaScript applications.



JavaScript is a popular, versatile programming language that allows developers to create dynamic and interactive online applications. Variables and data types are two key elements in JavaScript that are required for storing and manipulating information within your code.

## Understanding Variables

Variables acts as a container that holds and stores data for later use. They allow you to assign names to values, thereby, making your code more readable and maintainable.

The `Var`, `Let` and `Const` keywords are used to declare variables. The variables are assigned a value using the assignment operator (=).
Variables holds different data types such as numbers, string, booleans, arrays, objects, and more. Now, let’s take a look at each one.

### Var

The `Var` keyword is an old method of declaring a variable and it’s not recommended due to its [hoisting](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-hoisting-in-javascript/) and [scope concerns](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/scope-and-closures-in-javascript/). Using `Var` can lead to accidental reassignment of variables.

```js [1,3] showLineNumbers
 var x = 5;

 var name = "Sophie";
```

> **Explanation:**
>
> `var x = 5` : In this line of code, a variable “x” is declared and it is then assigned (using the assignment operator = ) to a numerical value “5”.
>
>`var name = “Sophie”` : In this line of code, a variable “name” is declared and it is assigned to a string value “Sophie”.

Don’t worry about what a string is, you’ll get to know more about it later in this article.

```js [1-4, 6-9] showLineNumbers
var x = 10;
var y = 20;
var z = x + y;
var name = "Dave";

console.log(x); // 10
console.log(y); // 20
console.log(z); // 30
console.log(name); // Dave
```

> **Explanation:**
>
> `var x = 10` : In this line a variable “x” is declared and assigned to a number “10”
>
> `var y = 20` : A variable “y” is declared and assigned to a number “20”
>
> `var z = x + y` : A variable ‘z" is declared and it is assigned to the result of adding the values of “x” and “y”
>
> `var name = “Dave”`: In this line of code, a variable “name” is declared and is then assigned to a string value “Dave”.
>
> `console.log(x), Console.log (y)` : These prints to the console each of the value of variables “x” and “y”, which are 10 and 20 respectively.
>
> `console.log(z)` : This line prints to the console the result of the addition of var “x” and “y”, which is 30.
>
> `console.log(name)` : This line prints to the console the value of the var “name”.

### Let

The `let` keyword is the most common way of declaring a variable. This keyword is a good choice for declaring variables whose values will be reassigned.

```js [1-3,5-6] showLineNumbers
let x = 10;
let color = "Red";
color = "Blue"; // values can be reassigned

console.log(x); // 10
console.log(color); // Blue
```

> **Explanation:**
> 
> `let x = 10;` This line declares a variable “x” using the “let” keyword and assigns it to a number value “10”.
> 
> `let color = “Red”;` This line declares a variable “color” and assigns it to a string value “Red”
> 
> `color = ‘Blue";` This line reassigns a new value “Blue” to the variable “color”. The original value “Red” will be overwritten by the new value “Blue”.
> 
> `console.log(x)` : This line prints to the console the value of the variable “x”, which is “10”.
>
> `console.log(color)` : This line prints to the console the current value of the variable “color”, which is “Blue”.


### Const

The `const` keyword is used to create variables whose values you won’t reassign. They are useful for variables that should remain constant throughout their lifetime. This helps prevent accidental changes to your code and improves code maintainability.

:::note
The values of variables declared with `const` can’t be changed.
:::

```js [1,3] showLineNumbers
const pi = 3.14159;

console.log(pi); // 3.14159
```

> **Explanation:**
> 
> The above code block defines a constant named `pi` and assigns it the value 3.14159. This value represents the mathematical constant pi, which is the ratio of a circle’s circumference to its diameter.
> 
> `console.log(pi)`: Prints the value of the constant pi to the console
> The const keyword is used to declare a constant variable, it is useful for values like mathematical constants

## Understanding Data Types

There are different data types in Javascript, and they can be categorized into two, which are:

**1. Primitive Data Types**: This data type are the most basic type in Javascript and they can only hold a single value.

**2. Non-primitive Data Type**: This data type are the most complex type in Javascript and they can hold multiple values.

### 1. Primitive Data Types
There are different types of primitive data types in Javscript, which include:

#### i. Number : Numeric Values 
Number represents numerical values. They could be integers or floating-point numbers and are also used to perform mathematical operations.

```js [1-4,6-9,] showLineNumbers
let person1Age = 16;
let person2Age = 20;
const pi = 3.14159;
let totalAge = person1Age + person2Age;

console.log(person2Age); // 20
console.log(person1Age); // 16
console.log(totalAge); //36
console.log(pi); // 3.14159
```

> **Explanation:**
>
> `person1Age` and `person2Age` stores the ages of two people.
>
> `pi` holds the approximate value of the mathematical constant pi (a floating point value).
> 
> `totalAge` is used to calculate and store the sum of `person1Age` and `person2Age`.
>
> The line `let totalAge = person1Age + person2Age;` calculates the total age by adding the ages of two people and assigns the result to the `totalAge` variable.
>
> The `console.log` statements print the values of each of the variable to the console. `Person1Age : 16`, `Person2Age : 20`,  `totalAge : 36`, and value of `pi : 3.14159`

You can see that all of these are assigned to a numerical value.

**Use case :** In a E-commerce, you can use Numbers to calculate product prices, discount etc.

#### ii. String : Textual Data

String represent sequences of characters and textual data. They must be enclosed within a single (’ ‘) or double (" “) quotes.

```js [1-2,4-5] showLineNumbers
let name = "Patricia Lawson";
let greeting = "Hello, world!";

console.log(name); // Patricia Lawson
console.log(greeting); // Hello, world!
```

> **Explanation:**
> The code block defines two variables, name : which stores the string “Patricia Lawson” greeting : stores the string “Hello, world!”
> 
> The console.log statements then print the values of these variables to the console, console.log(name); prints “Patricia Lawson” console.log(greeting); prints “Hello, world!”
> 
> **Note:** It is a string data type when they are enclosed in a single or double quotes.

**Use case :** In a To-do application, you can use String to store the To-do tasks.


#### iii. Booleans : True or False

Booleans represents logical values either `true` or `false`. The are often used for conditional statements and logical operations. `true` means “yes or correct”, and `false` means “no or incorrect”

```js [1-2,4-5] showLineNumbers
let isWeekend = true;
let isRaining = false;

console.log(isWeekend); // true
console.log(isRaining); // false
```

> **Explanation:**
>
> The above code defines two boolean variables, `isWeekend` stores the boolean value “true”, indicating that it is indeed the weekend. `isRaining` stores the boolean value “false”, indicating that it is not raining.
> 
> The `console.log` statements then prints the values of these variables to the console. `console.log(isWeekend);` prints “true” because it is weekend. `console.log(isRaining);` prints “false” because it is not raining.

**Use case:** In a Social media application, you can use Boolean to determine if the user is a female or male when creating a profile.


#### iv. BigInt : Large Integers

BigInt are used to store numbers that are too large to be stored in the Number data type. They provide precise calculation for large integers. To create a BigInt, add `n` to the end of an integer or call `BigInt()`

```js [1-2,4-5] showLineNumbers
let largeNumber = 123456789023456789098765432155575643213456789n;
let y = BigInt(12345678909876543213456788904567890643224566788);

console.log(largeNumber); //  123456789023456789098765432155575643213456789
console.log(y); // 12345678909876543213456788904567890643224566788
```

> **Explanation:**
>
> `let largeNumber = 123456789023456789098765432155575643213456789n;` This line declares a variable named “largeNumber” and assigns it a large integer value. The “n” suffix indicates that this value is a BigInt.
>
> Same goes for `let y = BigInt (12345678909876543213456788904567890643224566788);`
>
> The `console.log` statements print the values of each of the variable to the console.
>`largeNumber : 123456789023456789098765432155575643213456789` and `y : 12345678909876543213456788904567890643224566788`

**Use case:** In a financial application, you can use BigInt to store values that are too big to be stored in Number.

#### v. Null : Absence of a Value

Null is used to explicitly state the intentional absence of a value. It represents “nothing “, “empty” or “unknown value”. It’s often used to intentionally set a variable to an empty state.

```js showLineNumbers
let emptyValue = null;

console.log(emptyValue); // null
```

> **Explanation:**
> 
> `let emptyValue = null;` This line declares a variable named emptyValue and assigns it the value “null”.
>
> `console.log(emptyValue);` This line prints the value of “emptyValue” to the console. Since “emptyValue” is assigned the value “null”, the output will be “null”.
>

**Use case:** Imagine you’re building a form where users can enter their information . You can use Null to indicate the user chose not to answer a particular question.


#### vi. Undefined : Uninitialized Variable

Undefined represents variable that has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value. It means the variable exists, but it doesn’t hold any specific data yet.

```js showLineNumbers
let name;
console.log(name); //  undefined
```

> **Explanation:**
> `let name;` This line declares a variable named “name”. Since no value is assigned to it, “name” currently has the value “undefined”.
>
> console.log(name); This line prints the value of “name”, because “name” is > “undefined”, the output will be : undefined.

**Use case:** Imagine you’re building an E-commerce website, when a user registers but hasn’t completed their profile, their profile information could be undefined.


### 2. Non-primitive Data Types

There are two different types of non-primitive data types in Javascript, which include:

#### i. Arrays : Ordered Collections

Arrays are used to store and manipulate multiple values in a specific order. Each of these value is termed an element, and the each of these elements can be accessed using their index number, which starts from “0”, because they are zero-indexed.
That means, the first element of an array is at index “0”, the second element is at index “1”, the third at index “2”, and so on.

```js showLineNumbers
let fruits = ["Strawberry", "Watermelon", "Grapes"];

console.log(fruits[0]); //Strawberry
console.log(fruits[1]); //Watermelon
console.log(fruits[2]); //Grapes
```

> **Explanation:**
>
> `let fruits = [“Strawberry”, “Watermelon”, “Grapes”];` This line declares an array named “fruits” and assigns it to the values “Strawberry”, “Watermelon” and “Grapes”.
> 
> `console.log(fruits[0]);` This line of code prints to the console the element at index 0 of the “fruits” array, which is “Strawberry”.
>
> `console.log(fruits[1]);` This line of code prints to the console the element at index 1 of the “fruits” array, which is “Watermelon”.
>
> `console.log(fruits[2]);` This line of code prints to the console the element at index 2 of the “fruits” array, which is “Grapes”.

**Use case:** Imagine you want to create a simple application that allows a user to input their favourite fruits. You can use a JavaScript Arrays to store the fruits.


#### ii. Objects : Unordered Collections

Objects are unordered collections of key-value pairs used to store data in a structured way and each of these key-value pair is termed a property.
An object literal is a collection of key-value pairs, enclosed in curly braces {}. Objects also allows you to store different data types and the properties can be accessed using the properties names.

```js showLineNumbers
let person = {
  name: "Doris",
  age: 18,
  isFemale: true,
  country: "Nigeria",
};

console.log(person.name); // Doris
console.log(person.age); // 18
console.log(person.isFemale); // true
console.log(person.country); // Nigeria
```


> **Explanation:**
>
> `Let person = { . . . };` This line declares a variable named `person` and assigns it an object literals.
> 
> `name: “Doris”;` This line defines a property named `name` with the value “Doris”. The `name` property is used to store the person’s name.
> 
> `age : 18;` This line defines a property named `age` with the value “18”. The age` property stores the person’s age.
>
>`isFemale : true;` This line defines a property named `isFemale` with the value “true”. The `isFemale` property stores a boolean value indicating the person’s gender.
>
> `country : “Nigeria”;` This line defines a property named `country` with the value “Nigeria”. The country property stores the person’s country.
>
> `console.log(person.name);` This line prints the value of the name property of the person object to the console, which is “Doris”.
>
> `console.log(person.age);` This line prints the value of the age property of the person object to the console, which is 18.
>
> `console.log(person.isFemale);` This line prints the value of the `isFemale` property of the person object to the console, which is true.
>
> `console.log(person.country);` This line prints the value of the country property of the person object to the console, which is “Nigeria”.

**Use case:** In an online store project, you might represent the product information as an Object, containing properties such as name of product, price, description, quantity available etc.
